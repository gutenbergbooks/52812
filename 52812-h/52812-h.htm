<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The story of the Islands of Majorca and Minorca
has never been told in our language in a condensed
form, although the interest is great from
an historical point of view, and the materials
sufficient, though not perhaps abundant. It is
so closely connected with the history of Aragon
and the recovery of the Sicilies from the intruding
Angevins that the two cannot be altogether
separated. The most that can be done is, as far
as practicable, to treat the Aragonese and
Sicilian events from a Majorcan point of view.
This has been attempted. The stirring events
of the conquest of Majorca by Jayme I., the
latter part of the reign of his son, and the reigns
of Sancho and Jayme III., as well as the adventures
and death of Jayme IV., the last of his race,
all belong strictly to Majorcan history, as do
the chapters on Balearic navigators and the
revolt of the ‘Comunidades.’ The story fills a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
gap in the history of Mediterranean countries
which may not be altogether unacceptable to
students. This has been one object of the writer.</p>

<p>Another object has been to supply more detailed
information respecting the events of former
times in the islands, for the use of the considerable
number of visitors who resort to them. The
interest of the scenery and of many localities
cannot fail to be much increased by a detailed
knowledge of the historical associations connected
with them.</p>

<p>My principal authorities have been the autobiography
of Jayme I., the Chronicle of Muntaner,
Desclot, Zurita, and the histories of Dameto and
Mut, edited by Bover. My thanks are due for
much courtesy and assistance from the Count of
Montenegro, H.M. Consul Don Bartolom&egrave; Bosch
y Cerda, and Se&ntilde;or Albareda of the Grand Hotel
at Palma, and to Mr. Gilbert Ogilvy for having
kindly made sketches for me of the memorial
chair at Alfavia.</p>

<p>The story of Minorca necessarily embraces an
account of the several British occupations, and of
some of the operations of the British fleet with
Minorca as a base.</p>

<span class="medium table">Of King Jayme I. of Aragon and how he resolved to conquer
Majorca and drive out the Moors</span></h2>

<p>Majorca has a very interesting history under its
Aragonese princes, and a history which has been
well told by those princes themselves and by a
loyal vassal who was a diligent seeker after truth.
But to understand it we must turn first to the
gorges of the Pyrenees and the ports of Catalonia.</p>

<p>By the middle of the eighth century the Moors
had overcome Spain up to the Pyrenees, and
established their rule and their religion in all
parts of the country. But there they had to
stop. They could not subdue the mountaineers
of Asturias and the Basque provinces. Strong in
their almost inaccessible valleys in the southern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
slopes of the Pyrenees, the ancestors of the nobles
of Aragon also held their Moslem enemies at bay.
Wild as those valleys were, they were beautiful
and productive. Evergreen oaks clothed the lower
slopes, succeeded by pine forests, and still higher
up are the bushes and trees of box so characteristic
of the Pyrenees. The mountaineers had
their flocks and herds, crops of barley and oats,
and abundance of timber. But there was a long
struggle before them.</p>

<p>The little kingdom of Navarre was founded
by Garcia Jimenes as early as 758, and Louis, the
son of Charlemagne, drove the Moors out of
Barcelona and established a Christian country
there about fifty years afterwards. At length the
kingdom of Aragon was founded by Ramiro I., a
son of the King of Navarre, and Buesca was taken
from the Moors and became the first capital of
Aragon. Then the great Alonso, surnamed ‘El
Batallador,’ having firmly established his power
in the plains, drove the Moors out of Zaragoza in
1118, which was thenceforth the capital of Aragon.</p>

<p>The marriage of Petronilla, the heiress of
Aragon, with Raymond Berenger, the Count of
Barcelona, raised the kingdom to a position of
importance among the nations of the Middle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
Ages. The Counts of Barcelona during three
centuries had ruled over a maritime people of
great energy. These rulers were, for the most
part, capable men, whether in war or peace. The
Berengers were great warriors. It is related
that the first of the family passed his hand,
covered with blood, down the face of his golden
shield after a battle, and ever afterwards the
arms of Barcelona, granted by the Emperor
Charles the Bald in 873 and eventually adopted
by Aragon, were <i>or four pales gules</i>.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> The old
arms of Aragon were a cross of St. George between
four Moors’ heads. They were quartered with
those of Barcelona after the union; but latterly
those of the Counts of Barcelona only were used.
Sicily was <i>per saltire</i> the arms of Aragon (Barcelona)
above and below, imperial eagles dexter and
sinister. As rulers of a maritime and commercial
people, the Counts were not found wanting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
Count Raymond, called the ‘Old,’ gave the
Catalans a code of laws and began the cathedral
at Barcelona, and his successors fostered the
rising importance of Catalan enterprise.</p>

<p>Aragon, like England, was a constitutional
monarchy, with the ‘Fueros de Sobrarbe’ as its
Magna Charta. The King could do nothing, in
peace or war, without the counsel of the nobles,
called ‘Ricos Hombres,’<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and there was a court
of appeal in the ‘Justicia Mayor.’ The Parliament
was composed of the ‘Ricos Hombres’ and
the ‘Syndicos’ of the towns. Next in rank to
the ‘Ricos Hombres’ were the ‘Infan&ccedil;ones,’
equivalent to ‘Hidalgos’ in Castille. The prefix
‘En’ was used in Aragon as equivalent to ‘Don’
in Castille. The Catalan language, allied to the
Proven&ccedil;al, was spoken by the people, and written
by lawyers, chroniclers, and troubadours. It was
extended to Valencia and the Balearic Isles, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
claims great antiquity. It was the language of
an enterprising commercial people, and was well
adapted to be a vehicle for romantic and national
songs.</p>

<p>The exact identity of duration of the two
dynasties of Plantagenets and Aragonese sovereigns
invites comparison. The heiress Petronilla
was the contemporary of our Empress Maud; and
Ferdinand, the last male of his race, was the
contemporary of our last Plantagenet, Richard III.
They were neighbours, the Pyrenees only separating
Gascony of the Plantagenets from Aragon and
Catalonia. They were cousins through Eleanor
of Provence. They were more than cousins, for
Raymond, the husband of Petronilla, chose our
Henry II. for the guardian of his children, and
the greatest of our kings, Edward I., was the
trusted umpire selected by Pedro III. of Aragon,
and the intended father-in-law of his son. Both
families were composed of remarkable men, renowned
for chivalry, bravery, and, in more
instances than was the case in most dynasties,
for wisdom as rulers.</p>

<p>Pedro II. of Aragon reigned from 1196 to
1213. He and his cousin En Nu&ntilde;o de Sans
fought at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa side
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
by side with the kings of Castille and Navarre.
It was the great conflict which finally settled the
preponderance of Christians over Moors. After
that famous victory the expulsion of the latter
was only a question of time. Pedro married the
heiress of Montpellier and became the Lord of
that barony, as well as of Roussillon and
Cerda&ntilde;a. This brought him in contact with Simon
de Montfort; and the King of Aragon appears to
have made an agreement with Simon by which
he gave his only son Jayme to be brought up at
Carcassonne with a view to his eventual marriage
with a daughter of De Montfort. Afterwards a
war broke out between Aragon and Carcassonne,
and Pedro was slain in a battle near the castle of
Muret.</p>

<p>The heir of Aragon was at Carcassonne, in
the power of his father’s enemy, and was only six
years of age. He was born on February 8, 1208.
Simon de Montfort at first refused to give him up;
but, owing to the intervention of the Pope, he was
restored to his subjects, and arrived at Montpellier
in safety with his cousin Ramon Berenguer
of Provence, who was the same age. This companion
of Jayme was the future grandfather of
Edward I. of England.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<p>Jayme I. of Aragon, surnamed the Conqueror,
was among the greatest sovereigns in an age of
great sovereigns, the age of Edward I. of England,
of St. Louis of France, of St. Fernando of Castille,
of Frederick II. of Germany. Accepted by his
Parliament and guarded by his nobles during his
minority, Jayme entered upon his duties as ruler
of a free people with every advantage. His person
is described by Desclot. He was very tall&mdash;over
six feet&mdash;with broad shoulders, small waist, and
well-proportioned limbs. He had a fair rosy complexion,
blue eyes, and auburn hair. He was
strong and active, very expert in all exercises on
foot or horseback, valiant and well-practised in
arms. He was courteous and affable to all classes
of people, and he was as merciful as he was brave.
There is one charming incident which throws a
very pleasant light on his character. It is related
in his own journal. His tent had been pitched
in one place for a considerable time, and when the
camp was moving it was found that a swallow had
built its nest between the tent-poles. The King
ordered that the tent was to remain pitched and
guarded until the young swallows could fly, saying
that the mother-bird had put herself under his
protection, and that he could not disappoint her.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
Jayme, when a boy, was married to a princess of
Castilla and had a son by her named Alonso,
who died young. But the mother of his other
children was Violante, daughter of King Andrew
of Hungary and sister of St. Isabel.</p>

<p>The first great enterprise undertaken by King
Jayme was the expulsion of the Moors from the
Balearic Islands, which they had possessed for
five hundred years.</p>

<p>Majorca, with its satellites Minorca and Ivi&ccedil;a,
forms a very fine possession. The largest of the
islands, with its fifty miles of extent and area
covering 1,300 square miles, is nearly square,
with its two large bays of Palma and Alcudia on
either side and a projection to the south-west;
but the grace and beauty of its outline should
have saved it from being called a ‘quadrilateral
trapezoid.’ A fine range of mountains, mainly of
Jurassic limestone (lias), occupies the western and
northern sides of the island, with peaks rising to
near 5,000 feet. The ‘Puig Galatzo,’ in sight
from Palma, is 3,500, and the ‘Puig Major,’
farther north, 4,700 feet in height. The mountainous
part contains lovely valleys, with much
terrace-cultivation of oranges and olives, many
flowering shrubs, and with the higher slopes clothed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
in forests of Aleppo pines. From this deep green
vegetation perpendicular cliffs and peaks of white
marble stand out against the deep blue sky.
There are lower hills near the south coast, but
the rest of the island is a most fertile <i>huerta</i> or
garden, covered with almond and apricot trees,
and crops or pasture beneath them. In the early
spring the whole is one vast sea of almond-blossom.
Ancient olive and carob trees take the place of
almonds near the skirts of the mountains. On
the northern side of the mountains, especially
at Miramar, with the sea far below and the
white peaks shooting up into the sky, the scene
is a perfect dream of loveliness.</p>

<p>The Arab conquerors fully appreciated the
beauty and advantages of Majorca, with its
inheritance of Carthaginian and Roman traditions,
ruins, and aqueducts. For does not the
chronicler Ask-shakandi describe the island as
‘one of the most fertile and best cultivated
countries that God ever made, and the most
abundant in provisions of all kinds’? while the
poet Ibn-al-labneh tells us that to its capital
‘the ringdove lent the prismatic colours of his
collar, and the peacock his beautiful variegated
plumage’!
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span></p>

<p>It was in 716 that Abdallah, the son of Musa,
overran the Balearic Islands, and they became
part of the empire of the Beni Umiyyah. During
this period they were fully occupied by Moors and
Arabs. When the great Cordovan empire fell to
pieces, a man of remarkable courage and ability
was governor of the town of Denia, on the Valencian
coast. This was Mujahid ibn Al Am&iacute;ri,
surnamed Abu-l-jayush, or the father of the army.
He was a Cordovan, and a freed man of Abdu-r-rahman,
son of the great conqueror Almanzor.
Mujahid retained possession of Denia, and made
himself Amir of the Balearic Islands in 1015. He
was an undaunted warrior, an experienced sailor,
and his large fleet dominated the eastern Mediterranean.
His son Ali, surnamed Al Muhtadi,
succeeded him in 1045, and was in close alliance
with the Christian Count of Barcelona, Raymond
Berenger I. A remarkable grant has been preserved
by which Ali ordered that all the Christian
clergy of Denia and the Balearic Islands were to
be under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Barcelona.
It is a proof of the liberal and tolerant spirit which
actuated the Spanish Muhammadan princes. Ali
was dethroned by one of this officers named
Mubashir, who reigned until 1114, and from that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
time, though the islanders throve and their capital
was enriched, the rulers became aggressive and
piratical. They were kept in check to some
extent by the fleets of the republic of Pisa; but
they made raids on the Catalonian coast, and even
sacked Barcelona on one occasion and killed its
Count. No Christian ship was safe, and at last
the cup of their iniquity was full. King Jayme
resolved that Majorca must be conquered and that
the Moorish must be replaced by a Catalan population.
It was time. The chroniclers call the Moor
who was then ruling at Majorca ‘Sheikh Bohibe,’
but his real name appears to have been Abu
Yahye ibn Ali Imran At-tinmeleli.</p>

<p>King Jayme, by keeping a journal, had an
immense advantage over other sovereigns. His
autobiography is deeply interesting in itself: its
truthfulness is self-evident, and it checks and
sometimes disproves the tales of careless chroniclers.
It was printed at Valencia in 1474 in Catalan, the
language in which it was written; was printed in
Spanish for Philip II. in 1557; and Mr. Forster’s
English translation, edited by Don Pascual
Gayangos, was published in 1883. Here we have
a detailed narrative of the conquest of Majorca at
first hand.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span></p>

<p>The young King was only in his twentieth year
when the great enterprise was undertaken. He
ruled over a free people, and it was necessary to
call together the Ricos Hombres, the prelates, and
the procurators of towns, and to submit his project
for their approval. They assembled in the old
palace of the Counts of Barcelona. Their assent
was unanimous and enthusiastic. The Archbishop
of Tarragona, too old to go himself, promised to
equip one hundred knights and one thousand
infantry. Then up rose En Berenguer de Palou,
the Bishop of Barcelona, who was not to be outdone.
He declared that he would go himself with
130 knights, one thousand soldiers, and a galley,
and that he would not return until the conquest
was complete. Other prelates&mdash;canons, abbots,
and monks&mdash;followed these examples, down to the
sacristan of Gerona, who promised to equip ten
knights. The most able and experienced general
among the nobles was the King’s cousin En Nu&ntilde;o
Sans, the Count of Roussillon, and he spoke in the
names of the principal Ricos Hombres, who were
En Guillem de Moncada, Viscount of Bearne by
marriage, a very great vassal; Ponce Hugo, Count
of Ampurias; Ramon de Moncada; Bernardo de
Santa Eugenia de Torrella; Jofre, Viscount of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Rocaberti; Hugo de Mataplana&mdash;all promising to
equip knights and foot soldiers according to their
means. The young son of a German count, named
Carroz, and many other volunteers, also followed
the King.</p>

<p>Ramon de Plegamans, a wealthy merchant of
Barcelona, contracted to supply arms, siege
equipage, and provisions; and the thoroughness
with which this was done impresses the reader,
more than the numbers of troops, with the wealth
and resources of the great Catalonian seaport.
As many as 143 vessels were assembled, including
25 full-sized ships, 18 undecked ‘taridas,’ and
100 flat-bottomed boats. The largest ship came
from Narbonne, and had three decks. The army
consisted of 15,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry.
All the latest machines for hurling stones and
protecting the besiegers were provided by the
enterprising Plegamans.</p>

<p>The vessels were assembled at the small ports
of Salou and Cambrils, near Tarragona, and the
expedition sailed on September 1, 1229. The
King’s orders were that the ship of Captain
Nicolas Bonet, with En Guillermo de Moncada on
board, should lead, and that young Carroz should
command the rear ship. The King was in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
galley belonging to Montpellier, his birthplace.
There was a light wind from the shore, but before
evening it began to blow hard from the south-west,
with a very heavy sea. The ships were
close-hauled, and making such bad weather that
the pilot wanted to put back. The King would
not hear of it. Towards sunset of the following
day the land was in sight, and next morning the
fleet was off Pollenza, the north-east extreme of
Majorca. But suddenly a strong ‘Proven&ccedil;al’
wind sprang up, and the ships were in great danger
of being driven on shore. By advice of an experienced
sailor, they stood along the north-west
coast of the island until the south-west extremity
was reached at a place called Palomera. The
King’s galley arrived first, and was followed by
the rest of the fleet, not one being missing. There
was a consultation with En Nu&ntilde;o and the Moncadas,
when it was agreed that the galleys should examine
the south-west coast for a good place to
land, while the rest of the fleet remained at
anchor. The King landed on a rock between the
island of Dragonera and the main, called Pantaleu,
where he passed the following Sunday. The
Moors had discovered the hostile fleet, and lined
the shore with a strong force of horse and foot.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>At midnight the fleet was got under way,
with all lights out, and in profound silence. The
main portion anchored in the bay of Santa Ponza,
and the rest in a neighbouring roadstead called
Porrasa. Thence the coast runs south to Cape
Calafiguera, and sweeps round the bay of Palma.
Here King Jayme landed with his army.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="medium table">Tells how King Jayme won a victory over the Moors of Majorca;
and gives some account of the Moorish capital</span></h2>

<p>The little bay of Santa Ponza was alive with
boats from the ships, pulling to the shore. The
first to land was a young Catalan ensign named
Bernardo de Riudemeya, who waved his pennon
as a sign for the others to follow him. As a reward
the King granted him the estate of Santa Ponza in
fee-simple. He was followed by 700 men and the
chief officers, including En Nu&ntilde;o, En Ramon de
Moncada, En Bernardo de Santa Eugenia de
Torrella, Bernardo de Champans, the Master of
the Temple, and his knights, making about 150
horse. A reconnaissance by Ramon de Moncada
found an advanced guard of Moors about a mile
away, which was attacked and put to flight.
When the King landed, he heard that this encounter
was proceeding, so he galloped off to the scene of
action with forty attendant knights. Seeing a
body of 400 Moorish infantry on a spur of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
hills, he attacked them furiously, put them to
flight, and returned well pleased. He found his
nobles in some alarm for his safety, and he was
seriously taken to task for running such risks
when so much depended on his life. Guillem de
Moncada told him that he ought to recollect that
the lives of all of them depended upon his safety.</p>

<p>The rest of the cavalry had arrived in the
rear squadron and had been landed at Porrasa,
where it was ascertained that the Moorish Am&iacute;r
with a large army was at Porto Pi, a small harbour
between Porrasa and the capital of the island.
This news was brought to the King at midnight,
and he called a council of war, when it was determined
to give the troops a good night’s rest
before the expected battle. At dawn Jayme and
his nobles heard Mass, and a sermon was preached
by the Bishop of Barcelona. All prayed fervently,
and were resolved upon victory. The King and
most of his friends had received the Sacrament
before starting, at Salou; but En Guillem de
Moncada had delayed until this moment, desiring
to do so on the very eve of battle.</p>

<p>Then the Moncadas, Mataplana, and some
other knights, with 5,000 men, commenced a
rapid advance against the enemy, apparently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
without orders. The Count of Ampurias followed
with his men. A desperate fight was commenced,
the Moors being in overwhelming numbers. Seeing
the danger, the King galloped forward with a
single knight, named Rocafort, in hopes of being
in time to make the vanguard halt until the rest
of the army could come up. He sent back
Rocafort, when he heard the clang of arms; with
an urgent message to En Nu&ntilde;o to bring up supports,
as the vanguard was surrounded. Jayme
was in extreme anxiety. He was heard to say to
himself, ‘En Nu&ntilde;o delays much. The Holy
Virgin preserve us!’ An experienced veteran,
En Nu&ntilde;o saw that all was in order before he led
the main body of the army into battle.</p>

<p>In about an hour En Nu&ntilde;o came to where the
King was, who had galloped forward without
arming himself. Bertran de Naya, one of his
servants, brought the royal accoutrements, and
Jayme put on his quilted coat, his coat of mail,
and iron cap in the field. He told the general
that the vanguard was engaged with the whole
force of the enemy, and a rapid advance was
made to the scene of action. Here the King met
a knight named En Guillem de Mediona, who had
great fame as a jouster in tournaments. He was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
coming out of the battle. He said he had been
wounded by a stone on the lip. In a severe tone,
King Jayme said that it was not seemly to retire
owing to so slight a hurt. Mediona blushed with
shame, turned his horse’s head and galloped into
the thick of the fight, where he found a soldier’s
death.</p>

<p>The King had been delayed by the necessity
of putting on his armour. He then advanced up
a hill which to this day is called ‘El Collado del
Rey,’ attended by only twelve soldiers. On reaching
the summit he found En Nu&ntilde;o marshalling
his forces for the battle, and close at hand the
vast army of the Moors, with the Am&iacute;r’s red-and-white
banner, the staff surmounted by a human
head. The King, full of martial ardour, wanted
to charge at once, but was restrained by En Nu&ntilde;o.
Both armies joined battle, and, after a long
contested engagement, the Moors broke and fled.
The rout was so complete that the Am&iacute;r took
refuge in the mountains instead of returning to his
capital. The Aragonese troops were too tired to
continue the pursuit, and soon very sad news was
brought respecting the fate of the vanguard.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Barcelona had to announce to
the King that both En Guillem de Moncada,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
Viscount of Bearne, and En Ramon Moncada were
slain, and that nearly all their men were cut to
pieces before the main body of the army arrived
on the field. Hugo de Mataplana was also among
the slain. Young Jayme burst into tears at the
loss of so many dear friends and comrades. The
whole army mourned with their King. But they
were now in sight of the beautiful city, the capture
of which would be the crown of their enterprise.
The King was dead tired and nearly famished, for
he had eaten nothing all day. Going down a
mountain spur, in company with En Nu&ntilde;o, they
came upon a tent pitched under the pine-trees,
amidst brushwood consisting of tree heaths,
lentisco, and wild lavender. There was the smell
of a good dinner in preparation, and here the
tired warriors appeased their hunger, their host
being En Oliver de Termens, a gallant Frenchman
of Roussillon. When the King rose from an
excellent meal he said, ‘Ben dinat,’ which in
Catalan means ‘well dined.’ The spot retains the
name to this day. Long the property of the
Caro family, from which sprang that gallant
Marquis de la Romana who brought the Spanish
troops from Denmark to join in the War of Independence,
the historical spot has been much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
changed in recent times. A stately castle with
towers at the angles, surrounded by gardens and
orange-groves, has taken the place of En Oliver’s
tent where the young King dined so well 680
years ago. It was built in recent years by the
Hungarian Marquesa de la Romana, who afterwards
sold it. The castle of Bendinat is now
owned by the Marquis de la Torre.</p>

<p>The interment of the great lords who were
slain in the vanguard was conducted with all the
pomp that was possible. A stone pillar surmounted
by an iron cross now marks the spot. On one side
is the date, September 12, 1229; on another the
date of erection, 1884; and on a third the arms
of Barcelona impaling those of Moncada (<i>gules,
four bezants in pale</i>). It is on the left-hand side
of the road, just halfway between Palma and
Andraix, under the shade of a fine old pine-tree.</p>

<p>The scene of these military operations is
exceedingly beautiful. The spurs from the main
chain of mountains by the western sea are well
covered with pine and ilex forests, and rise one
behind the other. From them spurs covered with
olives and carob-trees and an undergrowth of
bright green crops and grass slope down to the
sea. Some of the spurs form a lower chain,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
called the Sierra de Burguesa, overlooking Porto
Pi and the capital.</p>

<p>The exposed bay of Palma, fifteen miles across,
has the little harbour of Porto Pi on the west side,
and the city of Mallorca, afterwards called Palma,
in its centre. In Moorish times the city was an
important commercial port, with a great fleet of
piratical galleys. It had a strong wall and ditch,
and eight gates. The bed of a mountain torrent
formed the moat on the west side. On the sea-face
there were three gates: one leading to the
mole, called ‘the Gate of Chains’; another to the
west, called <i>Balbelet</i>, leading from the <i>Dar-as-San&acirc;&aacute;</i>
or arsenal, corrupted by the Catalans into
‘<i>Atarazana</i>.’ In the east of the sea-wall was
the <i>Hicolbelet</i>. On the right of the Gate of Chains,
within the walls, stood the Moorish palace, which
appears to have been a small town in itself, called
<i>El Med&icirc;nah</i>, and by the Spaniards to this day
<i>Almudaina</i>. On the east side there was a gate
near the south-east angle, since closed up. Near
the north-east angle was the <i>Belalcofol</i>, called by
the Spaniards ‘<i>Pintada</i>.’ On the north side was
the <i>Barbolet</i>, now the <i>Puerto de Jesus</i>. The Moors
had two gates on the side of the torrent, facing
west, the <i>Belalbelet</i>, since closed, and the gate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
of Porto Pi, now called <i>Catalina</i>. Altogether
there seem to have been eight gates in the Moorish
walls. Besides the <i>Almudaina</i> there was a strong
castle near the south-east angle of the town,
which was given to the Knights Templars, and
near the centre stood the chief mosque. Of other
public buildings in Moorish times there is no notice.</p>

<p>The city of the Moors, owing to its wealth
and importance, must have contained many fine
and richly furnished houses; but such an active
energetic people as the Catalans very soon replaced
them with churches, convents, and houses in their
own style, and there is but one vestige left. Walking
down a street at the back of the cathedral,
called ‘Serra,’ to the sea-face, the shrubs and
flowers of a garden show themselves over a high
wall. A flight of steps leads to the garden, and in
one corner an archway opens on the ruins of a
Moorish bath, though nothing is left but the bare
brickwork. There is a dome supported by twelve
pillars, with capitals apparently from the ruins of
a Roman temple, the pillars about eight feet high,
and the conventional leaf capitals not exactly
fitting them. Round the dome there is a vaulted
passage, with recesses for piping. This is all that
remains to bear witness of the Moorish palaces
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
and houses, with their wealth of arabesque work
and bright colouring, their marble pillars and
pavements, their cool gardens and fountains and
luxurious baths. All is now a dream of the long-buried
past.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium table">Tells how En Jayme besieged and took the capital, conquered
the whole island, and became the first Christian King of Majorca</span></h2>

<p>The rout of the Moorish army removed any
obstacle to the commencement of the siege of the
capital. The western side of the walls faced the
Catalans as they approached from the hills above
Porto Pi, but it was defended by a torrent-bed.
After a careful reconnaissance, it was resolved to
deliver the main attack on the north-east side, at
the <i>Belalcofol</i> gate, called by the Spaniards
‘<i>Pintada</i>.’ Accordingly the King formed his
camp facing this gate and about a mile distant,
at a place still called ‘El Real,’ or ‘the camp.’
It was surrounded by a ditch and strong palisades,
for it appears that the infantry went to sleep on
board the ships every night, leaving only the
knights and artillery in the camp.</p>

<p>Mallorca was very strongly fortified, the walls
being of great thickness, with towers at intervals.
It was therefore determined to batter down the
walls and make a breach with the artillery so
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
efficiently provided by the zealous contractor,
Ramon de Plegamans. The King mentions four
kinds of artillery for hurling rocks against the walls,
which he calls <i>trebuchets</i> or catapults, <i>almajanachs</i>,
<i>algarradas</i>, and <i>fonebols</i>, the latter being the stone
balls themselves, not the machines. These were
the latest things in siege artillery; but the King
was not content with them and ordered a still
larger machine to be constructed out of the yards
and masts of the ships, as well as <i>mantellos</i> for the
protection of the workmen. The Moors had similar
artillery within the walls, one of their machines
with such a range as to reach the Christian camp.</p>

<p>The zealous ardour of the Catalan army was
stimulated and kept alive not only by the example
of the young King, but also by the fiery
eloquence of a friar preacher named Miguel Fabra.
All worked alike, from the King himself to the
meanest labourer. But although a continual
watch was kept round the walls, the Am&iacute;r succeeded
one dark night in effecting an entrance
with a number of his followers.</p>

<p>The Moors were not without supporters outside
the town, who were ready to harass the
Christians. One of the principal Moslem chiefs
in the mountains was Fatih-billah (‘Conqueror
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
by the grace of God’), a word corrupted by the
Spaniards into ‘Infantilla.’ About two Spanish
leagues<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> from the town there was an abundant
spring, with a channel leading from it, bearing a
copious supply of good water. The Christian camp
was pitched by the side of this channel. The place
where the spring rises is called Canet, near the foot
of the mountains. The actual spring was on a
wooded hill sloping down to a beautiful little
valley, with the main range of the mountains on
the other side. Fatih-billah hoped to do irreparable
injury to the besiegers by cutting off their
water-supply. So one night he went to Canet
with 500 footmen and 100 horse, occupied the
hill where the spring rises, and began to turn the
water into another channel. Directly this was
known at the camp, the King despatched a much
larger force under En Nu&ntilde;o and Torrella, which
surprised the Moors at their work. There was a
desperate encounter on the hillside; Fatih-billah
was killed, his men were cut to pieces, and the
spring remained in possession of the Catalans.
How changed is now the scene! The large
country house of the descendants of Torrella
dominates the valley of Canet, with its beautiful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
gardens and woods of fir-trees and heath beyond.
The hillside is terraced for olive-trees and carobs;
and a few years ago a stalactite cave was discovered
there, several hundred yards in length, the
entrance to which is close to the spot where the
battle between En Nu&ntilde;o and Fatih-billah must
have been fought. The cave was then unknown.
It would easily have held the whole of the Moorish
force, and the Catalans would have been unaware
of their proximity. The discovery appears to
have been made owing to a perforation in the
roof of the cave which made a hole in a field above.</p>

<p>This was the last attempt to molest the
besiegers from outside, or by sallies in force.
Nevertheless the King caused a tower called ‘El
Torre de las Lanoveras,’ between the capital and
Porto Pi, to be fortified, and a guard to be
stationed there, so as to keep a close watch on
the movements of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Catalans received important assistance
from the friendship of a very influential Moor
named Benahabet, who was anxious to be on the
winning side. He was highly connected, was
Governor of Pollenza and Inca, and owner of the
beautiful country seat of Alfavia. He sent a
messenger declaring that he would place a third
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
of the island in the power of King Jayme. Soon
afterwards he came himself with a very large
supply of fresh provisions, and was received into
the King’s grace. The supply was renewed every
week. Benahabet suggested that, as the towns
in his jurisdiction had submitted, two principal
Christian officers should be sent to bear rule over
them and to administer justice. Two such
officers&mdash;one a native of Barcelona, the other of
Montpellier were appointed with the title of
‘Baile,’ or Judge.</p>

<p>The besiegers continued to work hard at the
approaches and mines, both sides receiving much
injury from the stone-hurling artillery. Seeing
the rapid progress of the Christians, the Am&iacute;r
made a request that the King would send some one
to treat with him. En Nu&ntilde;o went, with a dozen
attendant knights and an interpreter. The Am&iacute;r
offered to pay all the expenses of the expedition
if the Christians would depart; but the King
positively refused to consider any such terms.
The Am&iacute;r then prayed for a second interview, and
pitched a sumptuously furnished tent near Porto
Pi. Hostilities were suspended, and En Nu&ntilde;o
came again. The Am&iacute;r made a dissertation on
the impossibility of taking so strong a place, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
merely offered the same terms. When this was
again refused, he offered five besants for each
man, woman, and child, and to surrender the
town, if he was allowed a number of ships sufficient
to take all his people to Barbary. En Nu&ntilde;o came
back with this offer, but the relations and friends
of the Moncadas insisted that the place should be
taken without any treaty or agreement. At first
En Jayme was inclined to accept the Moor’s offer,
but eventually he gave way to the strong feeling
of his nobles, and all negotiations were broken off.</p>

<p>As soon as he found that there was no hope
from negotiation, the Am&iacute;r resolved upon a
desperate defence. He addressed his people,
urging them to defend their religion, their liberty,
and their homes to the death. He met with a
determined response, and the resistance became
more fierce and desperate than ever. The Count
of Ampurias conducted the mining operations,
and eventually at least forty yards of the wall
fell in. The breach was defended with such
furious valour that the besiegers were forced to
retire, while the Moors hastily built up another
wall. A few days afterwards, on the Saturday
after St. Andrew’s,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> another piece of the wall,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
with a tower, fell in heaps. With the accord of
the army, the King then resolved to deliver the
assault on the following Sunday morning. Still
the resistance was so resolute, the furious struggles
for positions so prolonged, that it was the last day
of December before the general assault could be
given.</p>

<p>At dawn the troops heard Mass and received
the Sacrament. The King made a speech to
animate the men, with whom he promised to
conquer or die. They advanced to the ruined
walls, where the ‘<i>Puerta Pintada</i>’ stood, and 300
footmen rushed over the breach, followed by
cavalry. The Moorish Am&iacute;r was at the head of
his bravest warriors, and soon a desperate battle
was raging in the street now called ‘San Miguel.’
Mounted on a white horse, and armed at all points,
the gallant Moor courted death, and kept shouting
to his men, ‘Stand firm! Stand firm!’ The
brave defenders died in heaps where they stood,
but the impulse of the Catalans was irresistible,
and they reached the front of the chief mosque,
leaving heaps of dead behind them.</p>

<p>This mosque was turned into the first Christian
place of worship, and is now the church of San
Miguel. The figure-head of the King’s galley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
was a Virgin and Child. It was placed in the
church of San Miguel, where it remains to this
day.</p>

<p>Here there was a pause. The Moors still
fought hard to prevent a further advance into
their city, while stones and timber were hurled
upon the assailants by women and children on
the roofs. So long as their Am&iacute;r led them the
Moors continued the struggle, but at last he
retired in despair. Then the inhabitants began
to pour out of the gates now called Jesus and
Catalina, and fled towards the mountains. The
dead could be counted by thousands. The King
placed himself at the head of his troops and led
them through the town until he reached the
‘Almudaina’ palace on the sea-face. Those
within it surrendered on condition that their
lives were spared.</p>

<p>The house in which his brave antagonist the
Am&iacute;r Abu Yahye had taken refuge was pointed
out to King Jayme. He went there, accompanied
by his cousin En Nu&ntilde;o. When he entered the
room, the Am&iacute;r, who was in a white burnous and
quilted coat, stood up and tendered his submission.
The King received it with courtesy, promised the
Am&iacute;r his life, and treated him with consideration,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
giving him in charge to two of his nobles. En
Jayme found the Am&iacute;r’s son, a boy aged about
fourteen, in the ‘Almudaina.’ He adopted the
young Moorish prince, converted him, and eventually
granted him a considerable estate in Aragon,
where he married the fair Eva de Roldan and
became Baron of Hillueca and Gotor.</p>

<p>Having placed a strong guard over the treasury
in the ‘Almudaina,’ the King, quite worn out by
the fatigue of so many days of anxiety and fighting,
retired to rest in the Moorish palace. On the
following morning the city was given up to sack,
and the spoils were enormous, consisting of great
quantities of gold and silver in many shapes, rich
clothing, arms, horses, and a thousand other forms
of riches. The soldiers were well repaid for their
labours. The sacking of the town was allowed to
proceed for eight days continuously. As many as
180 Christian captives were found and liberated.
Efforts were then made to bury the dead, but they
were ineffectual, and a terrible pestilence broke
out. One of the first victims was the Count of
Ampurias; many other leading nobles perished,
and great ravages were made among the soldiers
before the pestilence subsided.</p>

<p>The Catalan force had been much reduced by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
losses during the siege, by some having returned
home, and by the pestilence, and no reinforcements
had arrived. Yet the King insisted upon
attacking a large body of Moors who had taken
refuge in the mountains. Fortunately, the impregnable
castle of Alaro, which he left on his
right as he advanced, had been secured by his
ally Benahabet, and was not in the hands of the
Moors. The King led his men to the skirts of
the mountains, at a place called Bu&ntilde;ola, where
he appears to have sustained a serious reverse.
The Catalans fed before the mountaineers, and
never stopped until they reached Benahabet’s
town of Inca, near the centre of the island. The
King followed the fugitives with only forty attendant
knights, and sternly upbraided them for their
cowardice. He then returned to Palma with his
beaten troops.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a welcome reinforcement
arrived, which, however, only consisted of fifteen
well-armed knights. But their leader was a man
of exceptional importance. Hugo de Folch Alguer
was Master of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem
in Aragon and Catalonia, and was a veteran for
whom the King had a great regard. His request
for a grant of land for his Order was opposed at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
first by the nobles who had borne the heat and
burden of the day. It speaks much for the tact and
conciliatory skill of the young King that he eventually
succeeded in making the grant to the Master
with the consent and approval of all concerned in
the division of the land.</p>

<p>En Jayme then resolved to lead an expedition
against the Moors who had taken refuge in the
hills towards the south-east angle of the island.
Accompanied by En Nu&ntilde;o, the Bishop of Barcelona,
and the Master of the Hospitallers, the King
advanced to the site of Manacor, now the centre
of a vine-growing district. Here the news came
that many Moors were concealed, with their
riches, in almost inaccessible caves near the
south coast.</p>

<p>On the coast near Manacor is the <i>Cueva del
Drach</i>, one of the largest stalactite caves in
Europe, with several subsidiary caves and an
underground lake, over which the myriads of
stalactites present a fairy-like scene. Farther to
the eastward the caves of Arta are of still greater
extent, nearly 300 yards long, in three vast vaulted
halls, roofed by magnificent stalactites, some of
them assuming marvellous shapes. The approach
to the entrance, where there is a splendid view
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
over the sea, has now been made easy enough. In
the thirteenth century it was extremely difficult
and perilous. The young King led an assault on
the caves of Arta, but, unable to face the hail
storm of missiles on so narrow and dangerous a
path, his men were repulsed. A retreat was unavoidable,
and En Jayme went to dinner. The
Master of St. John, with his knights, then endeavoured
to set fire to some huts built round
the entrance of the caves. The plan was to
send two knights on to the heights above the
entrance, whence they were to shower down
darts made with artificial fire, so as to burn the
huts and fill the cave with suffocating smoke.
Two brothers named Antonio and Perote Moix
volunteered for this dangerous service. The plan
was successful, and the Moors, from fear of
suffocation, offered to surrender if no succour
reached them in eight days. Meanwhile the
Catalans were suffering from want of provisions.
The King himself, with En Nu&ntilde;o and a hundred
followers, only had seven loaves of bread amongst
them for a whole day. The rest of the army fed
on corn stored in the farms. The young son of
Ramon de Moncada, who secured the bread,
received for his arms ‘<i>on a field gules seven loaves or</i>.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<p>On Palm Sunday, 1230, the Moorish fugitives
in the various caves surrendered, to the number
of 1,500 men, women, and children, with an
immense quantity of wheat and barley, cows and
sheep, and jewels of gold and silver. En Jayme
returned in triumph to Palma, where his satisfaction
was increased by the arrival of a large reinforcement.
Soon afterwards some of the Moors in
the western mountains submitted to the conqueror.</p>

<p>The King busied himself with the political
settlement of the land, dividing the estates among
his nobles and knights, and granting very extensive
privileges to the Catalan settlers. He then
resolved to return to his Continental dominions.
En Bernardo de Santa Eugenia, Lord of Torrella,
was appointed the first Governor and Captain-General
of the kingdom of Majorca. His descendants
still enjoy the <i>quinta</i> of Canet and other
estates granted to him. His brother was the first
Bishop. The Moorish prisoners were made to
labour on the public works. Those who had submitted
voluntarily were allowed to retain houses
and lands, paying rent and cultivating the ground.
Some became Christians. Soon many settlers
arrived with their wives, while many wives of the
soldiers joined their husbands.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span></p>

<p>At length the day came for the King to depart.
He was much beloved, and there was general
mourning. He made a farewell speech, and the
knights who had gone through so many dangers
and hardships with him were affected to tears.
With only two galleys King Jayme embarked at
the port of Palomera on October 28, 1230, and
landed near Tarragona. He was received with
great rejoicings by all classes of the people.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="medium table">King Jayme’s last visits&mdash;Settlement of the island&mdash;Acts and
death of Jayme I., first King of Majorca</span></h2>

<p>The settlement of the country was continued
under Bernardo de Torrella, though there were
still about two thousand Moors holding out in the
mountains under a chief called by the Spaniards
Xoarp. Soon alarming news arrived that the
King of Tunis was preparing to reconquer Mallorca
with a large army, and that he had collected a
great number of ships to transport it. The
tidings were sent to the King, and were confirmed
by Plegamans, who was a newsagent as well as a
contractor. En Jayme resolved to go in person
to defend his island, in spite of the remonstrances
of many of his councillors, who deprecated his
exposure to so many dangers. The old Archbishop
of Tarragona went so far as to try and hold him
round the waist when he was getting into the boat
at Salou.</p>

<p>This time the King brought with him a cousin
to be Viceroy of Mallorca, in the person of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
Infante Pedro of Portugal. This prince’s mother
was Aldonza, sister of Alonso II. of Aragon and
wife of Sancho, King of Portugal; so that Pedro
was a first cousin of King Jayme’s father&mdash;the same
relation as En Nu&ntilde;o. He married the Countess of
Urgel, the greatest heiress in Aragon, and acquired
a position of importance in the country. The
Countess had died without children, and Pedro
received Mallorca on condition that he surrendered
all his rights in the county of Urgel. He seems to
have been a weak man, fond of his ease, and all
real power remained with Torrella and others
trusted by the King.</p>

<p>En Jayme, accompanied by En Nu&ntilde;o and the
Portuguese prince, sailed from Salou, and in two
days his little fleet was anchored in the port of
Soller, where the joyful news was received that
the King of Tunis had abandoned his intended
invasion, at all events for that year. The port of
Soller is on the north side of the island, about two
miles from the town, which is in the midst of a
lovely valley surrounded by magnificent mountain
peaks. Rich in the products of its harvests, Soller
was even then a place of trade, and En Jayme
found a Genoese vessel loading in its port. The
King must have been struck by the wonderful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
beauty of this side of his island, which he had not
seen before. Suliar (Soller) in Arabic means a
shell, like the golden shell at Palermo. It is
now, and probably was then, golden with orange
and lemon gardens; the higher slopes of the
mountains covered with pine and carob trees,
and the grand peaks raising their heads into the
sky. The loftiest peak in the island, ‘Puig Mayor
d’en Torrello’ (4,700 feet) is not in sight, being
concealed by the second highest, the ‘Puig de
Massonella’ (4,400 feet), on which the King
probably saw patches of snow. To the north-east
is a striking peak, called ‘Puig de L’Ofre’
(3,500 feet), and to the south the ‘Teix’ of
Valdemosa (3,400 feet). In the division the King
gave two-thirds of the Soller valley to the Count
of Ampudia, and one-third to Gaston de Moncada,
whose father was slain in the battle of Santa
Ponza. In riding from Soller to Palma King
Jayme had to cross a mountain saddle 2,000 feet
high, whence he had glorious views of the Soller
valley on one side, and of the fertile ‘garden’ of
Palma on the other. At the end of the descent is
the estate of Alfavia, the enchanting country seat
of Jayme’s Moorish ally, Benahabet. The estate
had been granted to En Nu&ntilde;o, but the Moorish
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
owners were allowed to retain it on paying a quit-rent.
Here the King probably rested before
riding across the ‘<i>huerta</i>,’ or garden, to Palma,
where he was received with transports of joy by
the people.</p>

<p>The King was unable to remain long away
from his Continental dominions. He left the
Infante Pedro of Portugal as Viceroy, Bernardo
de Torrella and a knight named Pedro Maza being
the real governors.</p>

<p>There were still over two thousand insurgent
Moors in the recesses of the mountains, and their
leader refused to surrender to anyone but the
King himself. On this being represented to En
Jayme, he resolved to pay a third visit to his
island kingdom, and sailed from Salou with three
galleys in May 1232. He landed at Porto Pi, and
was joyfully received by his loyal subjects, who
were able to show him great progress in the public
works at Palma. The cathedral had been traced
out on a site facing the sea, close to the east wall
of the Almudaina, and the royal chapel, which
was to be the apse containing the high altar, was
actually finished. Between the long lancet windows
there are marble statues of saints and angels
on corbels and under richly carved canopies,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
placed there at the cost of the Oleza family. This
chapel and one on either side were to form the
eastern ends of the nave and two aisles, not yet
commenced. The King was much pleased at the
progress that had been made.</p>

<p>The time had now come for the submission of
the other Balearic islands; but first the King
received the surrender of the Moorish mountain
chief, he and his followers being allowed to retain
their homes, paying rent to their overlords.
A few obstinate fanatics refused the terms, and
had to be starved out.</p>

<p>The Master of the Templars in Majorca, Friar
Ramon Serra, was the first to suggest to the King
that his galleys should be sent to Minorca, demanding
immediate submission and threatening that
the King would himself come with a large army
to punish any disobedience. The three knights,
Torrella, Maza, and Serra himself, were accordingly
ordered to proceed to Minorca with an
interpreter, and the King’s demand written in
Arabic. The Moorish Alcaide and headmen of
the town received the knights with much respect.
The letter was read to them, and they asked for
time to deliberate. This was granted. On that
very evening the King, with only six knights, was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
stationed on Cape Pera, the eastern extreme of
the island of Majorca, near Arta, with Minorca
clearly in sight. As soon as the sun set they fired
some immense piles of <i>lentisco</i> bushes, to make the
Minorcans believe that a great army was encamped
there. When the chief men of Minorca saw the
fires, they hurried to the Catalan knights to inquire
what they were. ‘It is the great army,’ they
were told, ‘that will come directly the King hears
of a refusal of his demands.’ Next day they
submitted, surrendered all their strong places, and
declared that they trusted in the clemency of the
King. Meanwhile En Jayme remained on the
Cape of Pera, continuing the stratagem of the
bonfires for four days, when the news of the
submission of Minorca without bloodshed was
brought and gave him great satisfaction. Iviza
and Formentera submitted in the following year.</p>

<p>The King was in Majorca during July and
August 1232. He granted very liberal <i>Fueros</i> to
the people and completed the settlement of the
island. The final document in which the distribution
of lands among the conquerors is recorded
was signed on July 1, 1232. The lands were
divided into <i>jovadas</i>, and these were subdivided
into <i>cuarteradas</i>, a <i>cuarterada</i> being a certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
portion of squared land, with each side forty
<i>brazas</i> in length. A <i>braza</i> was the length of King
Jayme’s arms from finger-tips to finger-tips, and,
as he was over six feet, this was a good fathom.
The length of each side of a <i>cuarterada</i> was therefore
eighty English yards. A <i>jovada</i> was originally
the portion of land that a yoke of bullocks
could plough in one day; but in the Majorca
division it was counted at sixteen <i>cuarteradas</i>.
The Arabic names were used, <i>rahal</i> being a house
or property near a town; <i>alqueria</i> a farm, a word
still in use; <i>beni</i> preceding a place-name meaning
‘the house of.’ As many as 573 <i>rahales</i> and
<i>alquerias</i> were thus granted by the King, the
grantees paying certain dues to the four great
feudatories, En Nu&ntilde;o, Count of Roussillon, the
Count of Ampurias, Gaston de Moncada, and the
Bishop of Barcelona. But this only includes half
the grants, the rest having been made by the great
feudatories themselves to their own followers.
Altogether upwards of fifteen hundred farms must
have been distributed. There was also a division
of the mills, and of the rights to running water.
The number of farms gives an idea of the flourishing
condition of the island in the time of the
Moors. They were succeeded by an equally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
energetic and intelligent race of farmers and
artisans.</p>

<p>The Knights Templars received the strong
castle near the south-eastern angle of the city
walls, afterwards called the Temple, and a great
number of farms. The Knights Hospitallers also
acquired very considerable landed property.</p>

<p>On a small island the population, under circumstances
like the conquest of Mallorca, is soon
changed. A great number of the Moors perished,
many escaped to Muhammadan Spain or Africa,
many were taken away by their new masters.
There is certainly no trace of Moorish blood
among the present inhabitants.</p>

<p>The government of Majorca, according to the
<i>Fueros</i> of King Jayme I., granted in 1240, consisted
of six persons, elected annually, called
<i>Jurados</i>, who formed the municipal authority.
The president, called <i>Jurado en cap</i>, belonged to
the class of nobles; two were citizens liable for
military service, two were of the merchant class,
and one of the labouring class. Until 1447 the
<i>Jurados</i> were co-opted, but afterwards a sort of
ballot was adopted. There was a General Council
of 143 deputies, the <i>Jurado en cap</i> presiding. The
deputies consisted of a fixed number of representatives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the capital and other towns, and of
knights, merchants, and artisans. There was one
judge, called the <i>Bayle General</i>, until the institution
of the Audiencia in 1576.</p>

<p>This was a remarkably liberal constitution for
the thirteenth century, and indicates the trust
and reliance felt by King Jayme in the loyalty
and good sense of his people. In this, as in other
respects, we are reminded of our own Edward I.,
his parliaments and legislation.</p>

<p>The conquest of Majorca was a matter of the
greatest importance to the island, but it was only
a brief episode in the long reign of more than sixty
years. En Jayme showed ceaseless activity in
the work of government, consulting assemblies of
his people, framing laws and granting privileges,
and settling complicated disputes. Popular representation
was strengthened under Jayme I.
He sometimes met the Cortes of Aragon in the
capital or one of the towns, and the Council of
Catalonia separately; at other times the representatives,
for special reasons, met in one assembly,
usually at Monzon. In one case the meeting was
called a parliament, in the other ‘Cortes Generales.’
Mr. Hallam, in his ‘Middle Ages,’ has given a
good general account of the Aragonese Constitution.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
En Jayme frequently visited the whole of
his dominions, and thus became intimately acquainted
with his people and their needs. In
1238, nine years after the conquest of Majorca,
King Jayme found it necessary, owing to the
frequent and audacious inroads of the Moors, to
undertake the conquest of the rich and important
kingdom of Valencia. The capital city was taken
at Michaelmas, and a Christian population substituted;
but it was a much longer military operation
to reduce the numerous strongholds up to the
frontier of Murcia. The work was finally completed,
and King Jayme, well named ‘El Conquistador,’
granted <i>Fueros</i> to his new kingdom of
Valencia, and a representative assembly, or Cortes.</p>

<p>It now becomes necessary to allude to the
King’s children and family relations. By his
wife Violante of Hungary Jayme I. had eight
children. Pedro, his successor in Aragon, Catalonia,
and Valencia, was born in 1243. In July 1262, at
the age of nineteen, he was married to Constance,
daughter of Manfred, King of Sicily, son of the
Emperor Frederick II., by Beatrice, daughter of
Amadeo, Count of Savoy. The marriage took
place at Montpellier. The second son was Jayme,
who was to succeed his father as King of Majorca,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
as well as to the possessions in the south of France.
King Jayme married his second son to Esclaramunda,
sister of the Count of Foix, the most
powerful nobleman in Gascony. The third son,
Fernando, did not turn out well. Of the daughters,
Violante married Alonso X., King of Castille, in
1248; Isabel became the wife of King Philip III.
(<i>le Hardi</i>) of France; and Constance of the Infante
Don Manuel of Castille. Maria was a nun, and
Leonor, the youngest, died in childhood.</p>

<p>The Infante Pedro of Portugal died childless
in 1244, and was buried in the cathedral at Palma.
En Nu&ntilde;o, the King’s cousin and most able general,
also dying childless, left all his vast possessions
to the master he had served so long and so
well. He was Count of Roussillon, Cerda&ntilde;a, and
Conflent.</p>

<p>After the marriages of his children, the last
great enterprise of En Jayme was undertaken at
the earnest request of his son-in-law, Alonso X.
of Castille. This was the conquest of the Muhammadan
kingdom of Murcia, in which his son Pedro
took a prominent part. The campaign was a
complete success, and King Jayme honourably
handed over to Alonso X. the prize he had won
at great cost and no little trouble. He also made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
some liberal grants in the south of Valencia to his
other son-in-law, the Infante Manuel.</p>

<p>Jayme was happy in his two sons Pedro and
Jayme, both brave, accomplished, and dutiful.
He determined to provide for both. Pedro was
to succeed his father as King of Aragon, King of
Valencia, and Count of Barcelona. He thus, by
the addition of Valencia, gave to his heir far more
extensive dominions than he had himself inherited.
To his second son, Jayme, he gave the kingdom
of Majorca, the counties of Roussillon, Cerda&ntilde;a,
and Conflent in the Pyrenees, inherited from
En Nu&ntilde;o, and the barony of Montpellier, the
inheritance of his mother. He declared his resolution
to make this division on January 19, 1248,
and his act was recognised and confirmed by the
Cortes in 1251, and again in 1262. Pedro could
have no cause for complaint, because he succeeded
to all that his father had inherited and a great
deal more. The division was confirmed many
years before the death of King Jayme, so that
both his sons had ample time to become reconciled
to an arrangement which was perfectly fair and
just in itself. Young Jayme, indeed, assumed his
position in Majorca as heir-apparent, and ruled
there under his father for several years.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>One of the last acts of En Jayme was to attend
a Papal Council at Lyons, where he was magnificently
f&ecirc;ted. This led to his contemplating the
command of a crusade, and his fourth and last
visit to Majorca was undertaken to raise recruits;
but it came to nothing. The great King died at
Valencia on July 27, 1276, in his seventieth year,
after a reign of sixty-four years. He was buried
with great pomp, but amidst the heartfelt sorrow
of his people, in the monastery of Poblet, near
Tarragona. Here his body rested in peace for
560 years. But in 1835 a vile mob sacked and
destroyed the monastery. The King’s coffin was
eventually taken to the cathedral of Tarragona.
It has found a final resting-place at Valencia,
where his sword is also preserved.</p>

<p>King Jayme I. of Aragon, ‘El Conquistador,’
was a remarkable man&mdash;one of the greatest men
of the thirteenth century. In his long reign he
consolidated his dominions, while preserving the
autonomy of each part which possessed a separate
history and separate interests. He rendered the
national assemblies more popular. He granted
privileges most liberally to his subjects, encouraging
agriculture and commerce. He gave an impulse
to municipal government by the appointment of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
<i>jurados</i> and by instituting the ‘Council of One
Hundred’ at Barcelona, a model for a popular
magistracy. By the publication of his ‘Libro del
Consulado de Mar,’ the first code of maritime law
of its kind, he formed a pattern which was adopted
by all other naval Powers. He compiled the
<i>Fueros</i> of Aragon and Valencia, and granted
those of Huesca on the model of the famous
<i>Fueros</i> of Sobrarbe. He was a patron of learning;
and the arts, especially architecture, flourished
under his fostering care. He founded the university
of Lerida. In his warlike undertakings he
planned all his operations with such care and
forethought that he was always successful. The
institutions perfected by King Jayme were so
thoroughly based on the interests and genius of
the people, that they lasted, with modifications,
for more than four centuries. Just, affable, and
sympathetic, the memory of Jayme the Conqueror
is enshrined in the hearts of the descendants of
his people, and when the seventh centenary of his
birth came round, on February 8, 1908, it was
seen that the great King is not forgotten. In
Majorca, on the day of St. Silvester, the day on
which Palma was taken, there was an annual
procession in which the bishop and the authorities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
joined, with En Jayme’s banner borne before them;
followed by a high Mass in the cathedral, when
all the people prayed for the soul of their beloved
King. Relics of King Jayme, consisting of his
saddle, a stirrup, and a helmet, were long preserved
at Palma. They are now in the royal
armoury at Madrid; and the procession which revived
old memories and aroused patriotic feelings
has itself become a thing of the past.

<span class="medium table">Tells how the King of Aragon took up Conradin’s glove; how
the Pope’s curses went home to roost; and how En Pedro kept
his tryst</span></h2>

<p>For fifty years after the death of Jayme I. we have
the guidance of that delightful old chronicler En
Ramon Muntaner, who had seen many years of
active service in the field before he took up his
pen to record the events of which he had personal
knowledge. He was born in his father’s house
at Peralada, near the frontier of Catalonia and
Roussillon, and thought he could just remember
the great King Jayme having been his father’s
guest for one night. But he left his home when
only eleven years of age, having been born in 1275,
the year before the death of the ‘Conquistador.’
After knocking about the world for half a century
and doing much faithful and honourable service
by sea and land, the old warrior retired to a farm
in the ‘garden’ of Valencia, called Xiluella.
There, in the year 1335, and at the age of sixty,
he tells us that a vision appeared to him when he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
was sleeping on his couch. It was revealed to
him that it was God’s will that he should arise and
write the story of his life and of the great marvels
he had witnessed, that they might be made
manifest. So the veteran wrote his story for the
honour of God, of His blessed Mother, and of the
House of Aragon. Muntaner is the Froissart of
Catalonia.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>Transparently honest and trustworthy, the
warrior-historian is a sure guide through the very
complicated events in which Jayme II., the first
separate King of Majorca, and his sons were more
or less concerned during those fifty years of which
Muntaner treats.</p>

<p>Pedro III. succeeded to the kingdoms of
Aragon and Valencia and the county of Barcelona.
His brother Jayme was present at the coronation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
at Zaragoza. Jayme then proceeded to Majorca,
and was crowned King in the cathedral. He had
practically ruled the Balearic islands for several
years before his father’s death, and was very
popular with the islanders. He also took possession
of his Continental dominions of Roussillon,
Cerda&ntilde;a, Conflent, and Montpellier.</p>

<p>The two brothers appear to have had very
different dispositions. Pedro was ambitious, bold
almost to rashness, and enterprising. Jayme was
more inclined to a life of quiet and peace. Both
had been devotedly loyal to their great father
during his life. Circumstances almost forced upon
Pedro a very glorious career of successful warfare
in a good cause. The same circumstances placed
Jayme in a position of extreme difficulty as
regarded his relations with his brother.</p>

<p>Jayme I. was scarcely in his grave when the
troubles commenced in the south of Italy and
Sicily with which the House of Aragon became
so closely connected. They arose entirely from
the malignant hatred of the Popes for that great
and enlightened Emperor, Frederick II., King of
Sicily, and from their unscrupulous ambition.
When the Emperor was succeeded by his son
Manfred, the papal enmity was transferred to him;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and the Pope appealed to all the Christian kings
to drive him from his dominions. St. Louis of
France refused to perpetrate this iniquity, being
a friend of the late Emperor. King Edward of
England refused, his aunt having married
Frederick II. The King of Castille refused.
Above all, the King of Aragon denounced the
scheme, his wife Constance being a daughter of
Manfred.</p>

<p>Still the Pope succeeded in his wicked design
in an unexpected way. The Kings of England,
France, and of the Romans, and Charles of Anjou,
brother of the King of France, had married four
sisters, the daughters of the Count of Provence.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
All were queens except the wife of Charles of
Anjou, and she was the eldest. This filled her
with envy and jealousy, and she tormented her
husband until he bethought him of a way to make
her a queen by doing the Pope’s dirty work and
becoming the papal King of Sicily. So, without
his brother’s knowledge or consent, he went to
Rome, and made the offer on condition that the
treasure of the Church was placed at his disposal.
The compact was made, the Pope crowned Charles,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
and he raised an army to invade the territory of
King Manfred.</p>

<p>Muntaner says truly that Manfred was one of
the most valiant kings in the world. He assembled
his army and met the invading host under Charles
of Anjou near the frontier of his dominions. The
battle raged fiercely, and Manfred would have
been victorious had not bribes, applied with the
help of the treasure of the Church, turned the
scale. There was treachery. The gallant King
was slain, his army was scattered, and the Pope’s
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> was enabled to occupy Naples and overrun
Sicily, which was occupied by the licentious
soldiery of Charles of Anjou. The papal nominee
used his success with unrelenting cruelty. The
wife and children of Manfred were shut up in a
dungeon. Conradin, the nephew and heir, came
from Germany with a small force, but was defeated
and taken prisoner. Charles caused him to be
beheaded at Naples, and, as is well known, the
young prince, when on the scaffold, threw his
glove into the crowd, praying that some one
would take it to King Pedro of Aragon, who
would avenge his wrongs.</p>

<p>Pedro III. took up Conradin’s glove to some
purpose. His death was the last success of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Charles of Anjou. The Pope had cursed the
family of the good Emperor. Never did curses
more persistently come home to roost.</p>

<p>The Catalans were fast becoming an important
naval power in the Mediterranean, and their King
fostered its growth with care. He established
arsenals and dockyards at Barcelona, Tortosa,
Cullera, and Valencia, and ordered smaller yards
to be formed at every port where there was
anchorage for his galleys. Cullera and Tortosa
were his principal dockyards. The men were so
well trained, the galleys and arms were kept in
such a state of efficiency, that Pedro was well able
to take up Conradin’s glove and to avenge the
death of Manfred, the father of his beloved wife
Constance.</p>

<p>The call soon came. The King of Aragon
was moved to anger when he heard of the death
of his father-in-law and of young Conradin.
Before taking any steps against the usurper, he
thought it well to secure himself from attacks on
the side of France. His brother of Majorca
was also anxious for his Continental dominions.
St. Louis of France had been succeeded in 1270
by his son Philip <i>le Hardi</i>, who had married Pedro’s
sister. An interview was arranged between the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
Kings of France, Aragon, and Majorca at Toulouse.
The negotiation which followed was so far
satisfactory that Philip solemnly swore never
to interfere in the affairs of Montpellier, and
professed warm friendship for both the Aragonese
Kings.</p>

<p>At this juncture the tyranny of the French
led to the ‘Sicilian Vespers.’ The people rose
throughout Sicily while Charles of Anjou prepared
to wreak vengeance upon them, collecting a large
army and fleet. The Sicilians turned to the King
of Aragon, whose wife was the heir to their King,
for help in their sore need, and their appeal was
not in vain. He was engaged in some successful
operations on the coast of Barbary, with a large,
well-appointed fleet, when the message reached
him. Pedro did not hesitate. He would take
up Conradin’s glove and defend the right. With
a fair wind, he caused his fleet to shape a course for
Sicily.</p>

<p>The King of Aragon landed at Trapani on
August 28, 1282. The whole population of Sicily
was overjoyed. The march from Trapani to
Palermo was a triumphal procession. Pedro was
crowned King of Sicily at Palermo, and immediately
afterwards he marched to Messina, to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
resist any attempt to invade the island on the
part of the French forces of Charles of Anjou.</p>

<p>Charles arrived before Messina with his army,
where he received envoys from the King of Aragon.
They told him, in the name of their master, that
he was a usurper; that he knew well that he had
no right to the kingdom, which belonged to the
Queen of Aragon and her sons as heirs of King
Manfred, and demanded that he should leave it.
Charles replied defiantly, and Pedro, calling all the
able-bodied men of Sicily to arms, prepared to
advance to Messina and attack the usurper, who
was besieging the town, by sea and land.</p>

<p>It is here necessary to give some account of a
peculiar body of light infantry which formed an
important part of the Aragonese army, and was
now destined to take a very active lead in sending
the Pope’s curses home to roost.</p>

<p>The origin of these troops, called <i>Almogavares</i>,
is said by Desclot and others to be as follows:
After Spain was overrun by the Arabs, many of
the fugitive inhabitants took refuge in fastnesses
of the mountains, whence they made incursions
into the open country, their necessities obliging
them to make no distinction between friends and
enemies. In course of time these outlaws were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
organised into tribes, and generations of men who
were always leading lives of danger and hardship
produced a race of most formidable fighting
soldiers. The Kings of Aragon transformed these
fierce wanderers into a new military organisation.
They became fanatically loyal troops, while retaining
their old customs and habits. They were
divided into companies, each under a captain,
named <i>almogadan</i>. They also had officers named
<i>adalid</i>,<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> who were guides for the routes, and who
also had authority to judge of what occurred in
the forays, and to divide the spoils. The dress of
an <i>almogarave</i> consisted of a smock, breeches,
leather gaiters, hide sandals called <i>abarcas</i>, a sort
of knapsack on the back to hold a day’s food,
and a belt round the waist with a dagger, and
a small bag containing flint and steel. The
<i>almogarave</i> never shaved and never cut his hair,
which was confined in a net. His arms were a
short lance and a few darts slung on his back. In
an ambush or night-attack they first made innumerable
sparks with their flints and steels in
all directions, then rushed furiously upon their
enemy with the war-cry of ‘<i>Desparte ferres!</i>’<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
shouts of ‘<i>Al mugabar</i>.’ This word may be allied to
the Hebrew ‘<i>muhavar</i>,’ which means a companion.</p>

<p>The <i>almogavares</i> were an exceedingly formidable
body of light infantry. Pedro sent 2,000
to Messina by forced marches, while he followed
with the main strength of his army. Arriving at
Messina, they were received into the town, but
the inhabitants were in despair at their ragged
and wild appearance, and feared that men like
these could never cope with the soldiers of Charles.
Their answer was, ‘We will show you what we are
like’; and at dawn they sallied out of Messina
and attacked the besieging army with such fury
that it was thrown into confusion. Charles of
Anjou thought the whole Aragonese army was
upon him. He hastily ordered his troops to embark,
and fled to the opposite coast; but his rearguard
was cut to pieces and all his baggage was
captured. The galleys of Aragon then attacked
the usurper’s fleet off Nicotera, capturing many
vessels and driving the rest on shore. A body of
<i>almogavares</i> was next taken over to the coast of
Apulia, where they defeated a French force at
Catona, the Comte d’Alen&ccedil;on, brother of the King
of France, being among the slain. Thus was
Sicily permanently delivered from the yoke of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
Charles of Anjou, and restored to its rightful heir,
the daughter of Manfred. King Pedro himself
crossed the Strait of Messina and captured several
towns in Apulia, including Reggio.</p>

<p>Charles of Anjou, beaten in every encounter,
sent a challenge to the King of Aragon, proposing
that their quarrel should be settled by one combat,
a hundred on each side. Pedro consented, and it
was arranged that the battle should take place
at Bordeaux, King Edward I. of England being
the umpire.</p>

<p>Before returning to Aragon to prepare for this
duel, En Pedro made a very important appointment.
En Roger de Lauria had been brought up
with the King as a boy, and his mother was for
many years in attendance on Queen Constance.
En Roger had since proved himself to be a valiant
and enterprising commander and an expert sailor.
The King appointed him Admiral of Catalonia,
Valencia, and Sicily; and he was by far the greatest
admiral of the thirteenth century. When it was
known that En Roger had received his <i>b&acirc;ton</i>
there was great rejoicing in the fleet and in the
city of Messina, a week of holidays, dancing, and
festivity, ending with a General Council, when the
King delivered a farewell speech. Next to En
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Roger de Lauria, the most trusted naval captains
were En Ramon Marquet and En Berenguer
Mallol. Leaving the kingdom of Sicily in peace
and well ordered, King Pedro sailed from Trapani
with his two captains and only four galleys,
arriving safely at Barcelona. The rest of the
great fleet remained under the command of En
Roger.</p>

<p>The beaten usurper went crying to Pope Martin
for more curses against the rightful heirs of Sicily,
and for more treasure from the coffers of Holy
Church. The requests of Charles of Anjou were
promptly complied with. The King of Aragon
was excommunicated, a crusade was declared
against him, and more funds were supplied to the
papal King, who then left Rome and proceeded
to his nephew of France. Pedro III., with all his
bishops and a loyal and united people at his back,
cared nothing for the Pope’s curses. The Pope
further gave orders to his Legate to absolve King
Philip of France from all the promises he had
ever made to the Aragonese kings; and to call
upon him to engage in an iniquitous crusade
against his neighbour and brother-in-law.</p>

<p>The first act of hostility was the equipment of
a fleet at Marseilles with the object of seeking out
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
and destroying the galleys commanded by En
Roger de Lauria. The Proven&ccedil;al Admiral Cornut
had with him twenty-two well-armed galleys, and
shaped a course to Malta, where he encountered the
fleet of Lauria, numbering only eighteen sail. The
two fleets, in order of battle, rammed each other,
and then came to close quarters. The Catalans
were well trained in the use of the crossbow.
Every shot told, and before long the decks of the
Proven&ccedil;al ships were cleared. The admiral of the
Marseilles fleet, with his friends and officers,
perished in the thick of the fight. All the twenty-two
galleys became prizes to Lauria, and the
glorious news was at once sent to Syracuse,
spreading joy and gladness throughout the island.
The castle and town of Malta surrendered, and
both Malta and Gozo were transferred from
the possession of Charles of Anjou to that of the
Aragonese rulers of Sicily. The return of the
fleet to Sicily was the occasion of great rejoicing.
En Roger was received as a hero at Syracuse,
Aci Reale, Taormina, and most of all at Messina,
where the victorious fleet finally anchored. Such
was the next reply to the Pope’s curses.</p>

<p>Very earnest requests had been made by both
parties to King Edward of England to act as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
umpire for the proposed duel, for he was known
to be the most upright and just prince in Christendom.
Both Pedro and Charles had sworn to be
on the spot on the day appointed. But it came
to the knowledge of King Edward that his cousin
of France and his papal uncle were not playing
the game. Instead of a hundred knights, they
were coming to the neighbourhood of Bordeaux
with an army of twelve thousand men, intending
to kill En Pedro and all who came with him.
Edward therefore resolved not to come, for he
would be unable to ensure fair play; and he sent
to tell the King of Aragon that, under the circumstances,
he was absolved from his oath. En Pedro
then set out upon the wildest and most romantic
adventure that ever was undertaken even in that
age of romance. The French King and his uncle
of Anjou had actually come to Bordeaux with a
large army; had set out the field of combat, with
a stand at one end for the King of England as
umpire, and a chapel at the other. The English
Seneschal of Bordeaux received them with courtesy,
but told them the reason why his master would not
be present. In spite of the warnings from King
Edward and of his own intelligence, En Pedro
was determined that nothing should prevent him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
from keeping his oath to be at the appointed place
on the appointed day. He knew that his own
people would never consent to his entering upon
such a madcap adventure. Whatever was done
must be done in profound secrecy. Pedro had an
envoy in Bordeaux, named Gilbert de Cruilles,
who was empowered to treat with the English
Seneschal; but even he was not in the secret at
first, though he constantly sent reports of the
French proceedings.</p>

<p>The King of Aragon went to Jaca, in the heart
of the Pyrenees, with a few attendants, and sent
for a horse-dealer of his acquaintance, upon whose
secrecy and probity he could rely. This merchant,
named Domingo de la Figuera, was a man of
considerable influence, carrying on an extensive
trade in horses between Bordeaux and Navarre,
Castille, and Aragon. He knew intimately every
road and path in the Pyrenees, every man who
frequented them, and every post and tavern.
The King explained his wild scheme to En Domingo.
The horse-dealer was to provide twenty-seven
horses, nine to be stationed along the road from
Jaca to Bordeaux, nine on the route from Bordeaux
to Navarre, and nine for a return journey
in Castille. En Domingo was to ride post as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
master, while the King and a young knight named
Bernardo de Peratallada, son of the envoy Gilbert
de Cruilles, were to follow as his servants, suitably
dressed, with light saddle-bags. They were to
ride at a great pace all day, stopping at an inn at
dusk. At early dawn they were to mount fresh
horses, which were to be ready saddled. The
King was to act as a squire, holding the stirrup of
En Domingo when he mounted, serving him at
table, while En Bernardo fed the horses; and then
the King and En Bernardo were to sup together at
a table apart, before lying down to sleep. En
Domingo was to post the horses at proper distances
in charge of men on whom he could rely,
but who were not to be in the secret. En Domingo
undertook to arrange all these details, and a day
was fixed for departure which would bring them
to Bordeaux on the eve of the appointed time.
Not a soul was in the secret save the King himself,
En Domingo, and En Bernardo.</p>

<p>All being settled, the King went to Zaragoza
to pass a few days with his wife and children,
taking a tender farewell of them on his departure;
but they little knew why he took leave of them
with more affection than usual and to what risks
he was about to expose himself.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<p>All being prepared, the three companions
started from Jaca. The King wore strong gaiters,
a doublet of canvas, and over all a very old and
shabby smock, with a cap, and a kind of hood
concealing his face. En Bernardo was dressed in
the same way; while En Domingo rode as their
master in a handsome dress and broad hat, fine
gauntlets, and with a smart saddle-cloth. En
Bernardo carried a great sack, containing six
loaves of bread to be eaten during the day, without
stopping. At the first inn the people asked En
Domingo why he came so late, to which he replied
that it was to keep the horses out of the sun; and
while he conversed with people outside, the King
got the supper ready and En Bernardo fed the
horses. The King then held the ewer of water
for En Domingo’s hands, served him at table,
and when En Bernardo came in, he and the King
had their suppers together at another table, then
lying down and sleeping until dawn. Fresh horses
were ready, and they went off at a gallop. On
the third evening they were within a league of
Bordeaux, where they stopped at a house whose
owner was a friend of En Domingo. Here they
had supper and rested for the night. At dawn
they were mounted again and riding to the field,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
it being the actual day appointed for the duel.
The master of the house went to Gilbert de
Cruilles, who was lodged near, to tell him what had
happened, and both rode off to the field, where, to
his amazement, Gilbert saw the King and his own
son. En Pedro took him aside and told him to
go at once to the English Seneschal of Bordeaux
and tell him that a knight from the King of
Aragon had arrived and wished for speech with
him; and to ask him to bring with him his notary,
six knights whom he could trust, and no one else.</p>

<p>En Gilbert went at once to the Seneschal, who
was with the King of France, and delivered his
message. The Seneschal then told the King that
a knight of Aragon had come who desired to speak
with him. ‘Go,’ said the King, ‘and afterwards
come and tell me what he had to say.’ So the
Seneschal went at once, with the best notary at
the English Court and with six knights of distinction.
He found the King on the field, who saluted
him courteously, saying: ‘Sir Seneschal, I am
here on the part of the King of Aragon, this being
the day on which he and King Charles have sworn
to encounter each other in this field. I therefore
ask you whether the King can come in safety, in
the event of his appearing this day?’ The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
Seneschal replied, in the name of the King of
England, that he could in no way guarantee his
safety; for he knew for a certainty that, if he
came, he, and all who came with him, would be
killed, that being the intention of the King of
France and his uncle Charles, who were here with
twelve thousand armed horsemen. ‘Very good,’
replied En Pedro. ‘Let this be written down by
the notary and witnessed’; and the Seneschal
gave the order for this to be done. The notary
wrote it down, and when he came to the name of
the Aragonese knight the Seneschal asked him for
it. ‘Can all here be trusted?’ asked En Pedro.
‘Certainly,’ was the answer, ‘on the faith of the
King of England.’ ‘Then, Seneschal, you know
me,’ said the King of Aragon, and he threw back
his hood. The Seneschal recognised him at once,
and went down on his knee, saying, ‘Oh, sir,
what is this that you have done?’ ‘I have
come here,’ replied the King, ‘to keep my oath;
and I desire that all you have told me and all
I do may be written down in full by the notary,
certifying that I have come this day in person,
and that I have searched out all the field.’ He
then rode down the field and to every part of it,
in the presence of the witnesses, and while the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
notary was writing. After he had galloped up
and down several times, he dismounted at the
chapel and offered up thanks to God that he had
been enabled to keep his oath. They then all
rode back to the house of the host of the previous
night, and the King dismounted and went in to
thank and take leave of his hostess, who was
overcome by the honour when she heard who her
guest was. En Pedro sent a request through the
Seneschal to the King of England that his host
might receive a suitable reward. He also requested
that fair copies of the notary’s statement might
be drawn up, one to be delivered to the Seneschal
for transmission to the King of England, and the
other to Gilbert de Cruilles for the King of Aragon.
The perilous return journey was then commenced,
the Seneschal accompanying the party for about
a league. On taking his leave he told En Domingo
on no account to return by the way he came, nor
even by Navarre, because the King of France had
sent orders in all directions to seize anyone in the
service of the King of Aragon.</p>

<p>The travellers took the road to Castille, travelling
with great speed, not a single arrangement
made by En Domingo failing them in their need.
They went by Soria and crossed the Aragonese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
frontier at Moanquels. On reaching Calatayud
the King found that the news of his gallant adventure
had preceded him, and the people were in
transports of joy. At Zaragoza there were processions
headed by the bishops and clergy, in
spite of the Pope’s excommunication, to offer up
thanks for their chivalrous King’s safety.</p>

<p>When the Seneschal considered that the King
of Aragon was safe, he went to King Philip of
France and his uncle Charles of Anjou and told
them all that had taken place. On hearing such
news they made the sign of the cross more than
a hundred times, and were dumfounded. Then
they went to the field to see the marks of King
Pedro’s horse’s hoofs; and Philip expressed admiration
at the chivalrous daring of his brother-in-law.
Next day he broke up his camp and
marched away to Toulouse, with his uncle of
Anjou.</p>

<p>During four days there were festivities at
Zaragoza, joined in by the Queen and her children,
when the two faithful companions of the King,
En Bernardo and En Domingo, were f&ecirc;ted and
richly rewarded. Then En Gilbert de Cruilles
arrived from Bordeaux with the attested copy of
the notary’s statement, and with the news of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
astonishment and departure of the French King
and his uncle of Anjou: how they kept watch all
night, expecting to be attacked, and how they
went to look at En Pedro’s horse’s hoof-marks;
which gave rise to much laughter at Zaragoza.
In this way did the brave and chivalrous King of
Aragon keep his tryst.

<span class="medium table">Tells how the Queen of Aragon went to Sicily with her sons, how

<p>The connection of Majorca and its Princes with
the operations of the Aragonese in Sicily was so
intimate that their story would not be clear
without some account of the recovery of Manfred’s
kingdom for his descendants. We now come to
a time when Jayme II. of Majorca was placed in a
most difficult and embarrassing dilemma, owing
to the position of his Continental possessions
between France and Aragon.</p>

<p>After his return from the perilous journey to
Bordeaux, Pedro III., with the concurrence of
the Cortes of Aragon and Catalonia, came to a
very important decision. His queen, daughter
and heir of King Manfred, was to proceed to her
Sicilian possessions and thus ensure the loyalty
and devotion of the people who had been delivered
from the tyranny of Charles of Anjou by her
husband. She was to be accompanied by her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
two younger sons, Jayme and Federigo. The
latter was quite a young boy, there being an
interval of seven years between the two brothers.
The eldest son, Alfonso, was to remain with his
father. As a measure of State policy it was wise
and judicious. But the separation was a sacrifice
to duty and a cause of grief and anxiety both to
En Pedro and to Queen Constance. They never
saw each other again.</p>

<p>A fleet was fitted out at Barcelona with great
care, and every known appliance for ensuring a
safe voyage was brought into requisition. Even
the use of compasses is mentioned by Muntaner.
The discovery has usually been attributed to one
Flavio Gioia of Amalfi and to the year 1302. But
here we have evidence of their use a quarter of a
century earlier; while at about the same time
Raimundo Lulio of Majorca (I quote from a note of
Antonio de Borafull) wrote these words in his work
‘De Contemplatione’: ‘Sicut acus per naturam
vertitur ad septentrionem dum sit tacta a magnete.’
The ships, thus quite exceptionally provided and
well manned with Catalan crossbowmen, were to
be under the guidance of those trusty sea-captains,
Ramon Marquet and Berenguer Mallol.</p>

<p>There were religious services, but En Pedro
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
felt the parting with his beloved Constance so
deeply that he could not go with her to the ship.
He shut himself up alone for several hours. It
was his brother Jayme, the King of Majorca, who
accompanied the Queen and his two nephews to
the ship and saw them safe on board. The two
brothers spent that evening together, and next
day the King of Majorca set out for Perpignan.
Up to this time En Pedro and En Jayme were
on friendly terms. After a successful voyage the
Queen and her sons arrived at Palermo. They
were received with extraordinary enthusiasm, and
messengers with the joyful news were sent all over
the island. This return to the home of her childhood,
with such a reception, must have been a
cause of delight for the daughter of Manfred,
though not unmixed with sorrow. For one of
her sisters still lingered in a dungeon at Naples,
while the rest of her family had been relieved by
death. A vessel was at once sent back to Barcelona
with news of the safe arrival. The Queen had a
wise and loyal councillor in John of Procida, and
by his advice she assembled the Parliament of
the kingdom at Palermo. A letter was read from
Pedro III., announcing that he had sent his
beloved wife to take her place as rightful Queen of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Sicily. All the members swore allegiance to her
and her sons amidst a scene of enthusiasm which
was quite unanimous. The proceedings terminated
with a blessing from the Queen and a prayer
for the well-being of the representatives and of
the people they represented, who returned to
their homes. The Queen and her sons then
proceeded by land to Messina.</p>

<p>In the Admiral Roger de Lauria Sicily had a
defender whose invariable success since the battle
of Malta had filled his enemies with dread. The
young Prince En Jayme also gained a victory at
sea, and reduced the two castles still held by
Charles’s garrisons, Augusta and Cefalu.</p>

<p>The admiral was ready to sail from Messina
in June 1284 with forty armed galleys, besides
smaller vessels. With this force he gained one of
his most brilliant victories. He shaped a course
for Naples, and formed in line of battle about
two bow-shots from the mole, as a defiance and a
challenge. Charles of Anjou was intriguing at
Rome, but his eldest son and heir was in Naples,
and ready to accept the challenge. His followers
were not equally willing. The name of Roger de
Lauria was one of dread, and the Neapolitans
held back. The younger Charles was furious.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
He embarked himself, and shame obliged his
officers to follow. A fleet of thirty-eight galleys
and many smaller vessels was got ready, and came
forth to encounter the terrible Roger de Lauria.
A battle raged in the Bay of Naples from nine in
the morning until dusk, but as usual victory
attended on the banners of the admiral of Aragon.
The Prince’s galley was surrounded and boarded
by En Roger himself, to whom Charles, after a long
and brave resistance, was forced to surrender.
The admiral said to the usurper’s son: ‘You must
do two things. If not, be sure that the death of
Conradin will be avenged.’ The Prince answered
that he would do anything to save his own life.
‘The first thing,’ continued the admiral, ‘is that
you order the daughter of King Manfred to be
released from her prison and brought safely on
board my galley.’ This demand was complied
with. The long-imprisoned princess was taken
from the Castel del Novo and brought safely on
board the flagship, where the admiral joyfully
received the sister of his Queen, kneeling before
her and treating her with all honour and respect.
‘The second thing,’ continued he to Charles, ‘is
that you deliver up to me the town and castle of
Ischia.’ This also was done.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<p>The victorious fleet then returned to Messina
with the released princess and the captive prince.
Never had there been seen such rejoicings in
Messina as greeted the admiral on his return. The
Queen and her sons went on board the galley to
receive their long-imprisoned relation. It was a
most affecting scene. The two sisters embraced
each other, weeping for joy mingled with sorrow.
Since they had seen each other their father Manfred
and their cousin Conradin had been killed; their
mother and all the rest of their family had died
in prison. The crowd of spectators was equally
moved when the sisters, with the young princes,
walked together from the landing-stage to the
palace. Charles was sent to the castle of
Matagrifone.</p>

<p>The Sicilian Parliament met at Messina soon
afterwards and decreed the death of the younger
Charles, as a reprisal for the death of Conradin.
He would certainly have been executed if the
young Prince En Jayme had not interfered, preferring
the more generous course of returning good
for evil. Charles was confined for some time in
the castle of Cefalu, and eventually removed, by
order of King Pedro, to a prison at Barcelona.</p>

<p>The Pope’s curses kept coming home to roost,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
but this failed to divert him from his vindictive
course. His <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>, Charles of Anjou, was at
Rome when the disastrous news arrived, and must
have felt that retribution was overtaking him.
The usurper hurried back to Naples, but died
at Foggio on January 7, 1283. The Pope was
furious, and was more liberal than ever with his
curses. He placed the kingdom of Aragon under
an interdict, decreed the dethronement of En
Pedro, declared a crusade against him, made Charles
of Valois, the younger son of France, King of
Aragon, ordering him to be crowned, and called
upon the King of France to attack Aragon with
all his forces by land and sea. He further absolved
Philip of France from keeping his oaths and
treaties made with his brother-in-law of Aragon.
A papal Legate was to accompany the invading
army.</p>

<p>En Pedro sent an embassy to Rome, consisting
of grave and learned counsellors. In a dignified
speech their spokesman remonstrated with the
Pope and his cardinals. They were, however,
obdurate, and all the answer they would give
was that the Holy See could do no wrong.
Finally the ambassadors made a solemn appeal
from an unjust vicegerent to St. Peter himself and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
to God, who would defend the right, and so
departed.</p>

<p>En Pedro prepared to defend his country,
confident in the loyalty of his people and the
justice of his cause. He had an interview with
his nephew Sancho, the usurping King of Castille,
who promised to give him all the assistance in
his power. He also discussed the situation with
his brother of Majorca. They were several days
together at Gerona. The position was a most difficult
one. If Jayme opposed the advance of the
French army through his Continental dominions
their permanent loss to the house of Aragon would
be inevitable. If he offered no opposition he
would be giving an advantage to his brother’s
enemy. The brothers chose what appeared to be
the least of two evils. En Jayme was to allow
the French army to march across his territories,
and to avoid any action which would furnish a
pretext for their annexation.</p>

<p>Philip (<i>le Hardi</i>) can hardly have had any heart
in the enterprise which was forced upon him by
the Pope. His eldest son, who had a strong
feeling of regard and admiration for his uncle
En Pedro, openly disapproved. When his younger
brother, Charles of Valois, talked of himself as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
King of Aragon, Philip said to him: ‘You, little
brother, are not fit to take the place of our uncle.
You are scarcely fit to be king of what is under
your cap. You will never be King of Aragon.’
There was an angry quarrel, and their father had
to separate them. But Charles got the name of
King Cap, ‘<i>le roi du chapeau</i>.’ Nevertheless, it
was generally believed that little Aragon would
have no chance against the whole power of France,
and that the campaign could have but one result,
and would be over in a few weeks. The oriflamme
was unfurled, and a great army, led by the King of
France and accompanied by the Cardinal Legate,
advanced to the Catalonian frontier. A formidable
fleet was also equipped, to overpower the
naval forces of Aragon and to keep up the supplies
for the army in the bay of Rosas. In April 1285
King Philip encamped with his army at Perpignan.
The French were constantly harassed by night
attacks from the Aragonese; and at last, after
a fortnight of hesitation, Philip determined to
attempt a passage into Catalonia by the hill of
Panisars. Here he was attacked on all sides,
suffering very serious losses. Then young Philip
turned to his brother and said: ‘See now, pretty
brother, how glad your subjects are to see you!’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
His father overheard the sneer and was very angry.
‘Hold your tongue, Philip. They will be made
to repent what they are doing.’ ‘Ah, Sire,’
answered his son, ‘I mourn for your honour and
for the evil that is being done you. The Pope
and cardinals have brought this upon you, and
have made my brother king of the wind, while
they take their pleasure, caring little for the
danger and evil with which you are menaced.’
The King was silent, for he knew very well that
his son had merely spoken the truth. But it was
too late to repent and turn back.</p>

<p>Following the advice of some monks, Philip
got possession of another pass, known as the
‘Collado de Masona,’ and his army was thus
enabled to invade Catalonia. The little town of
Peralada was taken after a brave resistance, and
siege was laid to the city of Gerona. But the
French army was harassed by incessant attacks,
and was entirely dependent for supplies on the
navy which guarded the transports conveying
provisions from Marseilles and Cette to the bay of
Rosas. Here was the weak point.</p>

<p>En Pedro received information from the
gallant sea-captains Marquet and Malliol, who were
ever on the watch, that the French King had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
160 galleys; that his admiral kept sixty well-armed
in the port of San Felio; that another
fifty cruised between San Felio and the bay of
Rosas; while twenty-five plied between those
ports and Marseilles with provisions. Another
twenty-five remained in the bay of Rosas, under
the command of a brave knight, M. de Lod&egrave;ve.
The proposal of the Catalan captains was to
watch for an opportunity when the other cruisers
were out of sight, and to fall upon the twenty-five
French galleys in Rosas Bay at early dawn. The
King approved of their daring scheme, and at
the same time he sent to Sicily for the Admiral
Roger de Lauria to come with sixty galleys and
attack the rest of the French fleet.</p>

<p>Marquet and Malliol set out on their enterprise
with eleven galleys and two small vessels.
But never were crews better disciplined or more
carefully trained. They made sail for the Cape of
Creus, where they ascertained that the twenty-five
French galleys were in Rosas Bay. As soon
as the Catalans came in sight, M. de Lod&egrave;ve sent
fifteen galleys to dispute their entrance into the
bay; while he intended to manœuvre with the
rest so as to cut off their retreat, that none might
escape. Marquet and Malliol formed in close
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
order to prevent the enemy from dividing their
line, and ran on with a view of boarding. Their
trust was in their crossbowmen. The Catalans
considered that no one was a crossbowman unless
he was so familiar with every part of his weapon
that he could make it or repair it. Each man
carried a box containing all the tools necessary;
and the Catalans were so constantly trained in
the use of the crossbow that no other people could
compete with them.</p>

<p>The Catalan captains manœuvred so as to
secure the greatest advantage for their special
weapon. Every shot told; while the French,
with swords and lances, were unable to return the
attack, being shot down when they attempted to
board. When the French decks were nearly
cleared, Marquet and Malliol ordered the trumpets
to be sounded as a signal for his galleys to separate
under oars and attack the enemy on their broadsides.
Then began an unequal combat, the
Catalans boarding at the sword’s point, while
the French had already suffered so severely as
only to be able to offer a feeble resistance. The
whole of the twenty-five galleys were captured,
with a loss of upwards of four thousand on the
part of the French, and of barely a hundred on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
the Catalan side. This naval battle was a combination
of consummate seamanship with consummate
gunnery practice, the one of little avail without the
other.</p>

<p>M. de Lod&egrave;ve had sent a boat to apprise fifty
French galleys cruising in the offing of the approach
of the Catalans, and they made sail for Rosas
Bay. The winds were light and baffling, and the
Catalans, with their prizes, were only sighted
after the battle was over. The French admiral
could not overtake his victorious enemy, but he
stationed twenty-five more galleys in Rosas Bay,
and returned to San Felio.</p>

<p>As soon as the Admiral Roger de Lauria
received his orders he left Messina with sixty-six
well-armed galleys in search of the French fleet,
steering for a rendezvous at the island of Cabrera.
Here he received tidings from the Captains Marquet
and Malliol that there were eighty-five French
galleys in Rosas Bay. They informed the Admiral
that they would join him, with sixteen galleys,
off a cape known as Aygua Freda, near some small
islets called the Formigueras.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> Admiral Lauria
ordered that each galley should have three lights
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
ready&mdash;one in the bows, another amidships, and a
third at the stern. If the French fleet approached
at night, all were to be suddenly lighted, that the
enemy might believe each light to be on a separate
vessel. Towards dawn the French fleet approached,
and all the lights suddenly appeared between the
fleet and the shore. Before it was broad daylight
Lauria had entirely defeated his adversary,
capturing fifty-four galleys, driving fifteen on
shore, and putting twenty-five Genoese auxiliaries
to flight. Marquet and Malliol completed the
rout by capturing the remaining French galleys
in Rosas Bay, and taking or destroying all the
stores and provisions for the French army. The
admiral proceeded to Barcelona, having by this
great naval victory obtained complete command
of the sea.</p>

<p>There was nothing left for the great French
army but an ignominious flight. The Cardinal
Legate said that the Aragonese must be devils.
King Philip told him that they were nothing of
the kind, but brave and loyal soldiers, defending
their King against an unjust invasion; and he
expressed his regret that he had ever undertaken
it at the Pope’s urgent call. The Cardinal remained
silent. En Pedro assembled his army on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
hill of Panisars to intercept the retreat. The
French King raised the siege of Gerona and fell
back on Peralada with the remnant of his forces.
Many had died of sickness, while the losses in
numerous harassing encounters had been most
serious. The King of France was very ill, anxiety
and regret hastening his end. Feeling that he
was dying, he sent for his son, and said: ‘You
were wiser than I. Had I followed your advice
I should not now be on my death-bed; nor would
the many brave men have been lost who have
died and will die in this war. Send a message to
your uncle of Aragon and ask him to allow my
body to pass with yourself and your brother.
For I am certain that it rests with him whether a
single Frenchman shall ever return, dead or alive.’
The dying King then obtained a promise from his
son that he would be a friend and protector of
his brother Charles. The King died on September
30, 1285, in the house of a knight named
Vilanova, about two miles from Peralada. When
En Pedro received the message from the young
King Philip he sent orders that the late King’s
body was to be allowed to pass with its escort,
and requested his brother of Majorca to meet it
with a body of cavalry and protect it from attacks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
For Lauria and his sailors were watching on one
side, and bands of wild <i>almogavares</i> on the other.
But safety could only be assured to those who
passed with the corpse and the oriflamme. The
Count of Foix with five hundred horsemen went
first, then the young King and his brother with
the oriflamme, following their father’s body. The
Cardinal Legate came close behind, careful of his
own safety. He said that the rest would go to
Paradise. The Aragonese could no longer be
restrained, and fell furiously on the remainder of
the retreating host and on the baggage. The
Cardinal was so terrified that he died of fright a
few days afterwards; while the King of Majorca
escorted his nephew, the young King of France,
with his brother Charles and the body of the late
King, through his dominions.</p>

<p>The victorious King En Pedro, after making
liberal grants to the towns of Peralada and Gerona,
returned to Barcelona with his principal nobles.
On the same day the Admiral Roger de Lauria
arrived with the fleet, and there was great rejoicing.</p>

<p>This time the Pope’s curses went home to roost
with a vengeance. En Pedro was firmer on his
throne than ever. Sicily was safe. The Pope’s
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> was in prison at Barcelona. The Pope’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
King of Aragon was only king of what was under
his own cap. The Pope’s machinations were
scattered to the winds.</p>

<p>Yet the papal intrigues continued to cause
trouble and dissensions.</p>

<p>Jayme II., the King of Majorca, was obliged,
owing to the exigencies of the times, to reside in
his Continental dominions. By his wife, Esclaramunda,
sister of the Count of Foix, he had four
sons, Jayme, Sancho, Fernando, and Felipe, and
two daughters named Isabel and Sancha. Isabel
was the wife of the Infante Juan Manuel, brother
of the King of Castille. Sancha married King
Robert of Naples. Jayme and Sancho were at
Paris, detained by the King of France, practically
as hostages. Fernando’s age was then about
eight, the elder brothers ten and twelve.</p>

<p>There had been an understanding between the
brothers Pedro and Jayme during the war, and
communications had passed between them respecting
the safe passage of the French King’s body,
and on other matters. Soon after the final rout
of the French strange tidings reached En Pedro
from his agents in Italy. He was assured that
the Pope would induce the King of France to
seize Majorca, and that Jayme would be forced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
to give his consent, because his two sons were in
the French King’s power in Paris, and Montpellier,
Roussillon, and Conflent would otherwise be taken
from him. En Pedro resolved to prevent this.
He did not see how, in the face of these threats,
his brother could refuse, and he must therefore
act promptly; but he sent a letter to his brother
Jayme explaining the motives of his action. The
force destined for Majorca was placed under the
command of the King’s eldest son, Alfonso, and
consisted of knights, men-at-arms, and two
thousand <i>almogavares</i>.</p>

<p>The King of Aragon was incensed with his
nephew Sancho IV., the usurping King of Castille,
because he had broken his promise and given
him no help whatever in the war with France.
Fernando, the eldest son of Alfonso X., had died
before his father, leaving two sons, Alfonso and
Fernando, known as the ‘Infantes of La Cerda.’
The next son, Sancho, had usurped the throne,
and the ‘Infantes de La Cerda’ had escaped into
Aragon. En Pedro was having them educated
in the castle of Jativa in Valencia. He was
so angry with Sancho that he contemplated
setting up the eldest Infante as a claimant for the
throne of Castille. Having taken leave of his son
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
on the eve of his departure for Majorca, En Pedro
commenced a journey to Jativa to see the Infantes
of La Cerda. He was feeling unwell when he
started, and on reaching the town of Villafranca de
Panales he was in a high fever. His son was on
board, but had not sailed, when he got the news.
He hurried to Villafranca, but his father ordered
him to return to his ship and make sail at once.
Receiving his father’s blessing, the young Prince
departed and embarked at the port of Salou. He
landed with his forces at Porrasa, and no resistance
was made to his occupation of the capital of
Majorca. En Pedro was dying. He had made
his will and received the Sacraments, but neither
wife nor sons were at his bedside. He died on
November 11, 1285, and was buried in the abbey
of Santa Creus, about twenty miles from Villafranca.
His great admiral, Roger de Lauria, died
a few years afterwards, and his body was laid to
rest near that of the King he had served so well.
In 1835 a vile mob of ruffians destroyed the
church and scattered the remains to the winds.
By his wife Constance he left four sons and two
daughters. The eldest succeeded him as Alfonso III.
The second succeeded his brother as Jayme II.
Federigo, the third, was King of Sicily. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
fourth was Pedro. Of the daughters, Isabel was
Queen of Portugal, and Violante of Naples.</p>

<p>Pedro III., if not equal in all respects to his
father, was a great king. Fortune smiled upon
him. He was happy in all relations of life. His
career was one long romance. Chivalrous to
recklessness, he was at the same time prudent
and circumspect&mdash;a rare combination. Even in
his wild gallop into imminent peril at Bordeaux
he thought out every part of the enterprise down
to the minutest detail. He was invariably well
served, and invariably successful. This cannot
be ascribed to luck. A king who succeeds in all
he undertakes must have rare gifts of head and
heart to plan out the details of his undertakings
and to secure the sympathy and devotion of those
who serve him. Pedro was thus gifted, while his
administrative ability ensured the prosperity of
his country. Under him Aragon became a great
naval Power, and Sicily was freed from a foreign
yoke.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="medium table">Tells how young Federigo held Sicily against all odds, how
the Catalan Company went to the east, and how Jayme of
Majorca was restored to his island home</span></h2>

<p>The news of the King’s death was at once sent to
Majorca and to Sicily. Alfonso was only in his
twenty-second year&mdash;an impulsive, quick-tempered
youth, intolerant of opposition, but not guilty of
the cruelties imputed to him by some writers. He
refused to surrender the Balearic Islands to his
uncle again, and there was trouble about it during
the five years that his reign lasted. He returned
at once to Barcelona and went to mourn at his
father’s grave in the church of Santa Creus, previous
to the coronation at Zaragoza. His brother
Jayme was crowned King of Sicily at Palermo,
and in a successful campaign subdued all the
mainland of Calabria.</p>

<p>Through the intervention of King Edward I.
of England, negotiations were set on foot to
reconcile the King of Aragon with France and
the Pope; to make a compromise with his uncle,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
of Majorca, and for a marriage between
Alfonso III. of Aragon and the Princess Eleanor
of England, a daughter of Edward I. by his second
marriage. Young Alfonso spent some time with
Edward I. and the intended bride at Bordeaux.
He was induced to liberate Charles II. of Naples
on receiving his three sons and twenty nobles
of Provence in exchange. The other important
questions were in a fair way of solution through
the tact and diplomatic skill of the wise King
Edward, when a sudden stop was put to the
negotiations by the wholly unexpected death of
Alfonso. A neglected tumour on his thigh brought
on a fever of which he died at Barcelona when
only in his twenty-seventh year.</p>

<p>The Count of Ampudia and other great nobles
at once proceeded to Sicily to announce his accession
to Jayme. The new king embarked at
Trapani, landed at Barcelona, and was crowned
at Zaragoza as Jayme II. of Aragon. Sicily
remained under the rule of Queen Constance and
her son Federigo, who had now attained to years
of discretion and gave promise of becoming a very
able and resolute leader of men.</p>

<p>History is rarely quite symmetrical. One
would have wished to see the noble policy of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
En Pedro continued as firmly and resolutely by
his son. But this was not to be. Jayme II. of
Aragon was weak, and fell under papal influences.
There was a new Pope, and Boniface VIII. was
more diplomatic. Jayme first abandoned his
cousins of La Cerda, and made an alliance with
the usurping Sancho of Castille. He next made
his peace with France and the Holy See, and
acknowledged Charles II. of Naples as King of
the Sicilies. The treaty was signed at Anagni,
under the supervision of Pope Boniface. Jayme
was to marry Blanche of Anjou, to give up all
prisoners, and, worst shame of all, Sicily was to
be handed over to the Pope again. In return the
excommunication was taken off, and, in defiance
of all right, Corsica and Sardinia were to be handed
over to Jayme if he could drive out the Genoese
and Pisans who possessed those islands; but he
was to hold them in fief of the Pope.</p>

<p>Sicily was abandoned without the assent of
En Federigo, who was now grown up and was a
prince to be reckoned with. He sent Sicilian
envoys to remonstrate with his brother, but without
avail. He then resolved to resist the iniquity
and to defy his brother and the Pope. He had
against him the King of Aragon and his forces,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
France and Naples, and the whole influence of
the papacy. He had no ally. Yet he defied them
all, and swore that Sicily should be free. Many
of the Catalonian nobles who revered the memory
of his father rallied round the gallant young
prince. He was a true son of En Pedro. Volunteers
flocked to his standard. Above all, the
<i>almogavares</i> were staunch to a man. En Federigo
was proclaimed King of Sicily.</p>

<p>The Pope gave Jayme II. the titles of Gonfalonier,
Admiral, and Captain-general of the Church;
and, in addition to his marriage with Blanche of
Anjou, he married his sister, the granddaughter
of King Manfred, to the French heir of Naples.</p>

<p>Jayme II. received the standard of the Church
at Rome, collected eighty-three galleys, and sailed
to form a junction with the forces of Naples and
overwhelm his brother. En Federigo had an
able admiral in Conrad Doria, while Blasco de
Alagon commanded the land forces. The allies
made their first attack on Syracuse, where they
suffered disastrous defeats both by sea and land.
Charles of Naples then sent a force of 1,200 men,
in fifty galleys, under the command of his son,
the Prince of Tarentum, to effect a landing at
Trapani. En Federigo, with some of his Catalan
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
supporters, Moncadas and Entenzas, was ready
to defend the coast. The gallant young King
of Sicily led on the <i>almogavares</i>, who shouted
‘Dispierto hierro!’ and fell with such fury on
the invaders that they broke and fled. En
Federigo himself fought his way straight for his
enemy’s standard, and encountered the Prince of
Tarentum. After a short combat the Prince was
unhorsed, and would have been killed if Federigo
had not protected him. He was taken prisoner
and sent to the castle of Cefalu.</p>

<p>Charles and the Pope appealed to France for
help, dispatching ambassadors with an urgent
request that the King would send his brother
Charles of Valois, ‘the Cap King,’ with a large
force to invade Sicily. Accordingly he came to
Naples with four thousand men, landed at Termini
in Sicily, and besieged Sciacca. His people were
decimated by disease, the siege had to be raised,
and the expedition was a complete failure.</p>

<p>En Federigo had the rare gift, of surrounding
himself with the ablest and most efficient men.
Among these was the famous Roger de Flor. The
good Emperor Frederick II. had a German falconer
named Richard de Flor, who married the daughter
of a rich proprietor at Brindisi. When Prince
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
Conradin came to regain his right, Richard fought
for him and was killed in the battle. All his
property was confiscated and his widow was left
penniless, with two boys to support, Jacobo and
Roger. A ship belonging to the Knights Templars,
and commanded by a Serjeant Friar named
Vassayll, was wintering at Brindisi when Roger
was about eight years old. The little fellow went
up and down the rigging with such agility that
Vassayll took a fancy for him, and persuaded his
mother to let him go to sea and learn a sailor’s
duties. By the time he was twenty he had become
a very expert seaman, and the Master of
the Temple conferred on him the mantle of the
Order. He was then given the command of a
large ship called the <i>Falcon</i>. Friar Roger de Flor
soon acquired renown as a very able naval commander.
He was captain of another ship, called
the <i>Oliveta</i>, when he entered the harbour of Messina
and offered his services to En Federigo. He was
most cordially received, and he swore allegiance to
the young King of Sicily, with all his crew. His
first service was to capture several large Neapolitan
vessels laden with wheat and other supplies, with
which the garrisons of Syracuse, Augusta, and
Lentini were to be provisioned. He also captured
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
much treasure, enabling him to make liberal
presents to the nobles and to pay the wages of
the garrisons. For these services the King made
him Vice-Admiral of Sicily.</p>

<p>The Neapolitans were besieging Messina by
land and sea, led by Robert, the heir of Charles II.
When the town was almost at the point of starvation,
Friar Roger de Flor, the Vice-Admiral, manned
ten galleys, loaded them with corn, and waited at
Syracuse for a fair wind. It came on to blow very
fresh from the south, and he made sail in the
night, reaching the <i>faro</i> of Messina just before
dawn. By that time it was blowing very hard
and a heavy sea was raging in the strait, with
many cross-currents. The besieging ships saw
the galleys, but feared to raise their anchors in
such a sea. Friar Roger, with sails split and top
masts sprung, led all the ten galleys safely into
the harbour. Next day Duke Robert raised the
siege.</p>

<p>Jayme II. of Aragon was half-hearted in
this papal war against his young brother. He
obtained a grant from the Cortes of Catalonia,
and sailed for Sicily with fifty-six galleys.
Federigo put to sea with only forty vessels, and
there was a long-contested fight off Cape Orlando,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
a most fratricidal and unnatural strife. Jayme
had with him Almenany, Cabrera, and other great
Aragonese names. Round Federigo were Blasco
de Alagon, Hugo Count of Ampurias, Gombau de
Entenza, and others. It was a drawn battle, and,
in spite of the prayers of Charles of Naples and of
Pope Boniface, Jayme returned to Barcelona to
fight no more. He must have been ashamed of
the part he had been taking.</p>

<p>Very tardily the Pope came to see that all his
curses in a bad cause were of no avail, and that
they persistently came home to roost. He at
length consented that his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> of Naples should
negotiate with En Federigo, and acknowledge
him as King of Sicily. Charles of Naples met
the King of Sicily at Calatabellota, and agreed to
acknowledge him as king, and to give him his
daughter Leonor for his wife. In return Federigo
consented to evacuate Calabria. The marriage
took place at Messina in May 1302.</p>

<p>A very large army remained in Sicily without
employment. Friar Roger de Flor conceived the
idea of offering his services to the Emperor of the
East and of enlisting the Aragonese and Catalonian
soldiers to fight against the Turks. Berenger de
Entenza, Berenguer Rocafort, and many other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
Aragonese nobles and knights agreed to accompany
the renowned Templar, and more than
four thousand <i>almogavares</i> enlisted. An envoy
was sent to Constantinople, and the Emperor
Andronicus, with his son Michael, agreed to the
terms proposed, including the scale of pay. Friar
Roger was to be a Grand Duke and to marry the
Emperor’s niece; while liberal allowances were
promised to his companions. Among them was
our good and faithful chronicler Ramon Muntaner
himself. En Federigo furnished ten galleys to
transport the company of adventurers, provisioning
them well, and supplying his faithful Admiral
Friar Roger de Flor with necessary funds. The
whole party which finally sailed for the East consisted
of 1,500 cavalry, 4,000 <i>almogavares</i>, 1,000
other foot-soldiers, besides wives and children.
There were twenty-six sail of vessels, and all
embarked well pleased with the liberality of the
good King of Sicily and with the prospect before
them. At first the Emperor received them with
much cordiality, and the company landed near
Cyzicus on the Asiatic side, gaining some victories
over the Turks. Friar Roger was rewarded with
the title of C&aelig;sar, which had not been conferred
during four hundred years, and the company went
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
into winter quarters at Gallipoli. Michael, the
Emperor’s son, had conceived an intense feeling
of jealousy on account of the great honours conferred
on Friar Roger. He sent an invitation to
him to come to Adrianople, where he and all his
companions were massacred. Another massacre
was perpetrated at Constantinople; but the
treacherous Greeks were defeated with great
slaughter when they attacked the company at
Gallipoli. The company made several retaliatory
incursions, Muntaner being left in charge
at Gallipoli; but there were disputes between the
leaders, Entenza and Rocafort, and much need
of proper guidance and of a leader acknowledged
by all. At this time a Prince of Majorca began
to take a part in the affairs of the company and of
Greece; but before narrating his adventures we
must return to the island itself and to its restoration
to its rightful King.</p>

<p>King Jayme of Majorca had been unjustly
deprived of his islands by his nephew Alfonso III.,
and, while constantly protesting, he was obliged
to remain at Montpellier and Perpignan. But
after he had made his peace with the Pope, Jayme
of Aragon sought an interview with his uncle of
Majorca, greeted him affectionately, and restored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
to him the Balearic Islands. Both the King of
Majorca and the King of Aragon, uncle and
nephew, were Jayme II., which might cause some
confusion. For the next twelve years Jayme,
the uncle, reigned peacefully in Majorca.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<span class="medium table">Tells how King Jayme II. at last reigned in peace, and how his
page Raimondo Lulio attained the crown of martyrdom</span></h2>

<p>King Jayme II. of Majorca returned to his island
dominions in 1294 with fifteen years of life before
him, which he devoted to the restoration of prosperity
to Majorca. He was now advanced in
years, and was far better fitted for peaceful administration
and the work of promoting the good
of his people than for steering safely through the
entanglements and difficulties caused by the war
between his brother and his brother-in-law of
France.</p>

<p>His wife, Esclaramunda of Foix, was still by
his side, and his children were taking their places
in the world. His eldest son, Jayme, had adopted
a religious life and had become a Franciscan friar.
His second son, Sancho, was therefore to be his
successor, and was recognised as the heir by
the Cortes of Gerona in 1302. The third son,
Fernando, was one of the ablest and most valorous
soldiers of that chivalrous age, with honour bright
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
as his sword. The youngest son, Felipe, entered
holy orders. The two daughters married well&mdash;Isabel
to the Infante Juan Manuel of Castille, and
Sancha to Robert, King of Naples.</p>

<p>Majorca had suffered during the usurpation of
young Alfonso. Her commercial interests had
been neglected, and the foreign rule had been
tyrannical. At the same time the population
was increasing, and there was need for the foundation
of towns as centres of trade and protection
in the different districts. The companions of
Jayme I., forming the nobility of the island, held
large estates. The twenty most prominent names
were:</p>

<p>With the aid and consent of these nobles and of
the Jurados, Jayme II. founded several towns
which have continued to flourish to this day.
One of the first was Felanitx, on the plain to the
east of the capital. The next was Santa&ntilde;i, on the
estate of Sant Marti; and the King, owing to the
want of water, caused large cisterns to be constructed.
Binisalem, near Inca, was founded, and
is now a centre of apricot cultivation. Porreras,
Sineu, and Manacor were also founded; the latter
is now a flourishing town and a centre of the vine
industry. Lluchmayor, the scene of his grandson’s
fatal overthrow, was also founded by this King.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
These towns formed markets and homes for the
farmers of the surrounding districts.</p>

<p>King Jayme next established a coinage, which
for its purity and accuracy of weight was very
highly esteemed in all the Mediterranean commercial
marts. Gold coins began to be issued in
1310, but none are now known to exist. The
silver reals and double reals are handsome coins.
They are excessively rare. The silver coinage
began to be issued in 1300. The Mint-master was
Bernardo de Oleza, whose arms were gules a rose
argent. The rose appears on each side of the
crowned head, and in the four angles of the cross
on the reverse of the silver money.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>The representatives of the people agreed to
pay a tax, called <i>fogatje</i>, for the support of the
mint, assessed on all houses having hearths.</p>

<p>A pure currency is a great aid to commerce,
and the trade of Majorca increased rapidly under
the auspices of En Jayme. Shipbuilding progressed,
and the rich and fertile soil began to
yield abundant crops. The cultivation of olive-trees,
though many of them now present such an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
extraordinarily antiquated appearance, was introduced
into the island by the Catalans, and not by
the Arabs.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> The raising of stock also received
much attention from the King, who in this
as in other measures for the prosperity of
the island, was well supported by his ‘Ricos
hombres.’</p>

<p>The ‘Almudaina,’ or alcazar of the Moors, is
a huge bastille on the right of the landing-place.
The lofty walls still stand, enclosing a large space,
with square towers at intervals. The exterior has
undergone considerable modern alterations, but
it is still quite easy to make out the appearance of
the original building. King Jayme II. brought
artists and expert artificers from Perpignan to
convert this ancient alcazar of the Almudaina
into a palace. The royal apartments were decorated
with paintings and bas-reliefs, the beautiful
oratory of Santa Ana was built as the royal chapel,
pleasant balconies were erected, and gardens were
laid out in the courts and on the terraces. The
sculptor Fran&ccedil;ois Camprodon was employed to
adorn the halls and gardens with statues. A code
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
of palace etiquette was drawn up, and the Majorcan
Court was ceremoniously conducted, while at
the same time it was a home of pleasure and
festivity.</p>

<p>To the east of the Almudaina there was a
space, said to have been occupied by a garden in
Moorish times, on a high platform overlooking the
Mediterranean. No finer site could be found for
a cathedral. The Capilla Real had been finished
in the time of the Conqueror, but during the
usurpation work had been stopped. Funds were
raised under Jayme II. and the construction of
this beautiful edifice was continued. All the stone
came from the quarries of Santa&ntilde;i, on the south
coast of the island. The cathedral presents
rather a curious appearance from the sea, owing
to the crowd of flying buttresses and the absence
of windows, which are only allowed to give full
light through stained glass in the apse. The
nave is very lofty, with eight arches on each side,
between seven high and slender pillars supporting
a finely vaulted roof. There is a clerestory with
windows blocked, but no triforium. The aisles
are lower and rather narrow, with side chapels.
The lofty and slender pillars rising to the vault,
less than three feet in diameter, give a peculiarly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
solemn effect which is alike pleasing and imposing.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
The Bishop’s palace, built round a courtyard, is to
the east of the cathedral, and also overlooks the sea.</p>

<p>The King’s eldest son had devoted his life to
religion and had become a Franciscan monk.
Out of affection for him Jayme II. founded a
large Franciscan monastery. A fine church rose
up in due time, with a very picturesque cloister of
two storeys, other buildings used as schools, and
a large library with a richly carved wooden ceiling.
All came to ruin on the expulsion of the monks in
1835.</p>

<p>En Jayme also planned and commenced one
of the finest military works of his time. The
castle of Belver is a beautiful object from the
sea, standing on the summit of a pine-clad hill,
with a background of more distant mountains.
It is elliptical in shape, with a large courtyard in
the centre. The accommodation is spacious. On
the ground floor there is a series of vaulted
chambers suitable for barracks, guard rooms, or
prisons. Above there is a vaulted gallery opening
on numerous large rooms, also vaulted, including
a large hall and a chapel. The roof is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
flat and paved. Standing by itself there is a tall
tower, called ‘el Torre de Homenaje,’ connected
with the roof by an arch. The whole is surrounded
by a deep moat. Pedro Salva, the
architect, was a native of Majorca. The hill on
which the castle stands, 450 feet above the sea, is
entirely covered with pine-trees (<i>Pinus Halepensis</i>),
with an undergrowth of <i>lentisco</i>-bushes, wild
lavender, and a purple cistus. Between the
bushes the ground is covered with asphodel and
the leaves of an arisarum.</p>

<p>En Jayme brought architects, sculptors, and
decorators to Majorca, as well as troubadours and
musicians, and he encouraged native talent. But
the great ornament of his reign was an eminent
philosopher and theologian. Ramon Lull, or
Raimundo Lulio of Barcelona, was one of the
companions of Jayme I., and received two <i>alquerias</i>
or farms at the partition. He was married to
Heril de Catalu&ntilde;a, and their son Raimundo was
born in the capital of Majorca in about the year
1235. His parents wished him to learn to read,
but he cared for nothing but arms, and became a
page to En Jayme. He neglected his duties to
the Prince and gave up nearly all his time to
rather scandalous love affairs. His parents thought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
that the only cure was marriage, and they married
him to a girl named Catalina Labots; but this only
appeared to increase his devotion to other married
women. His conversion was miraculous. He had
a celestial vision in the garden of the bishop’s
palace, and another in his own house, when he
heard the words, ‘Raimundo, follow me!’ He
sold all his property, only reserving a small
portion for his wife and children, and in 1266 he
embarked for Barcelona to visit the shrines of
Montserrat and Santiago. He then returned home
to cause edification by his example in the same
place where his former life had been so scandalous.
He was well past his thirtieth year.</p>

<p>Lulio then began to learn Arabic from a slave,
with the intention of preaching to the Moors;
but one day he flogged his teacher for blaspheming
God, who retaliated by stabbing Lulio in the
breast. The new convert then left the abodes of
man and went up an isolated hill called Randa,
well in sight from the anchorage off the capital of
Majorca. Here his life was a continual succession
of prayers, penitence, and tears. He was favoured
with more celestial visions. His mind seems to
have been filled with zeal for the conversion of
unbelievers; and he also developed some crude
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
philosophical ideas in his solitude. Jayme II.
was at this time at Montpellier, and, hearing of
the miraculous conversion of his former page, he
sent for him. En Jayme was struck by the
earnestness, the eloquence, and the ability of the
new convert. When Lulio entreated the King to
establish a school in Majorca for teaching Arabic,
with a view to preaching to the infidels, he consented.
He made a grant of money sufficient to
sustain thirteen monks, and assigned for their
college a farm in a lovely spot on the north coast
of the island, overlooking the sea, called Miramar.
Here Lulio studied, and wrote his theories and
ideas; but his plan did not succeed, and the
college was a failure.</p>

<p>Lulio went to Rome, and then to Paris, where
he read his system and argued some points with
the famous Duns Scotus and his disciples. In
1290 he was at Montpellier and Genoa, whence he
embarked for Tunis. Here he preached the faith
of Christ openly, was beaten, and eventually
banished. He travelled through Armenia and the
holy Land; and afterwards wandered over Europe,
preaching a crusade to recover Jerusalem. Another
year found him at Paris once more, reading his
system, which at length received the approbation
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
of the University. In 1314 Lulio was again
travelling through Egypt and the Holy Land;
and two years afterwards we find him in England,
studying physics as then understood. During the
intervals of travel he diligently wrote books on
every imaginable subject. He reached his
eightieth year, and longed for martyrdom. So
he embarked in a vessel bound for Tunis, and
went thence to Bugia. He preached Christ openly
and persistently until he was taken out of the
town and stoned. Some Genoese begged for the
martyr’s body, and conveyed it to Majorca. The
date of the martyrdom was June 29, 1315. Lulio
was buried in the church of San Francisco. The
effigy of the martyr rests sideways and rather
high up on the wall of a transept; above it two
angels are bearing up his soul, below are the
arms of Lulio and Majorca, at the sides angels in
niches.</p>

<p>The philosophy of Lulio is part of the intellectual
history of his century, and can have no
place here; but this meagre sketch of his life
and acts is sufficient to show that he was one of
the most remarkable men of his time. Majorca
has good reason to be proud of him. His works
were read and taught in the Franciscan monastery
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
and elsewhere, and his statue at Palma is a sufficient
proof of the appreciation of his countrymen.</p>

<p>Raimundo Lulio survived his old master by
four years. Jayme II. continued to maintain
an excellent understanding with his nephew and
namesake of Aragon, affording him assistance in
ships and men in his conquest of Corsica and
Sardinia. He died in his palace of Almudaina on
May 28, 1371, and was succeeded by his second
son, Sancho. Among many adherents, his most
faithful friend through all his troubles was his
secretary, Guillermo de Puigdorfila. This noble
Majorcan was possessed of a large fortune, which
he devoted to the service of his master, and was
his most trusted councillor to the last. His
descendants continued to flourish in Majorca for
540 years, the last male dying in 1846.</p>

<p>Jayme II. was buried in the Royal chapel of
the cathedral at Majorca, and in 1779 Charles III.
of Spain erected a monument to his memory, in
doubtful taste. On a parchment at the lid of the
shroud it is recorded that: ‘Here is Jayme
(Jacma) of worthy memory, King of Majorca,
Count of Roussillon and Cerda&ntilde;a, Lord of Montpellier,
who departed this life in this city on the
28th of May, vigil of Pentecost, 1311, son of en
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Jayme, King of Aragon, who delivered this city
from the heathens.’ The body is well preserved
as a mummy. Jayme II. of Majorca was an
excellent king for peaceful times, and in the last
fifteen years of his life his administration was
most useful and serviceable to his country.

<span class="medium table">The career of Prince Fernando of Majorca; and tells how the

<p>Fernando, the third son of King Jayme II. of
Majorca, was a splendid type of a chivalrous
knight, trained to arms from early youth, eager
to win renown, but placing honour and his word
before all earthly considerations. He was very
young when he left his home in Majorca to fight
for his gallant cousin, Federigo of Sicily. After
the peace with Naples, Fernando still remained
with his cousin. Then news came of the murder
of Friar Roger de Flor, and of the critical position
of the Catalan company at Gallipoli, which place
they had held for several years, making occasional
raids into Roumania. The King of Sicily proposed
to his cousin Fernando that he should
assume command of the company in the name
of Federigo as over-lord. Fernando accepted the
charge. He arrived at Gallipoli with four galleys,
and announced that he came only as lieutenant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
and representative of the King of Sicily. Ramon
Muntaner, our worthy chronicler, who was in
charge at Gallipoli, received the young Prince in
the capacity announced in the diplomas he brought
from King Federigo as chief and commander of
the company. En Rocafort, with the greater
part of the forces, was besieging a town called
Nona, sixty miles from Gallipoli, and he requested
the Prince to join him. The other two chiefs of
the company, En Berenguer de Entenza and
En Ferrar Ximenes, remained at Gallipoli; but
the Prince, with Muntaner, proceeded to Nona,
where he was received with great honour. Rocafort
was at enmity with Entenza and Ximenes,
and secretly wished to get rid of the Prince so
as to have sole command of the company. He
therefore intrigued with all the chiefs and officers,
persuading them to accept the Prince as their
lord, but not as a representative of the King of
Sicily. They all agreed, and Rocafort knew what
the Prince’s answer, as a man of honour, must
necessarily be. When the Prince announced his
decision, he was entreated to remain until they
reached Salonica, to which place the company
intended to march, it being represented to him
that he might compose the differences between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
Rocafort and the other leaders. The Prince consented
to remain with them for a short time with
that object.</p>

<p>Gallipoli was to be abandoned, and the duty
of destroying the castle there and bringing away
the wives and children of the company was entrusted
to Muntaner. He did this, and brought
the people to Cristopol, at the entrance of the
Salonica territory, in thirty-six vessels, consisting
of galleys, armed <i>le&ntilde;os</i>, and armed boats.</p>

<p>The whole company, including Entenza and
Ximenes with their troops, then began their march
to Salonica. On the second day there was an
affray in which Entenza was killed, Rocafort pretending
that his men mistook Entenza’s men for
enemies. Ximenes fled. The Prince, who now
saw through the designs of Rocafort, was in a
very difficult position, when his four galleys most
opportunely arrived at the part of the coast where
the company was encamped. A council was called,
and the Prince told Rocafort and his party plainly
that if they would not receive him as vicegerent
of the King of Sicily, he would leave them. Rocafort
induced the leaders to declare that they
would receive him only as their lord, independent
of any one else. Prince Fernando therefore embarked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and went with his four galleys to the
island of Thasos.</p>

<p>Rocafort’s ambition led to his ruin, for his
own people became tired of his tyranny and
greed. He wanted to make himself King of
Salonica, but there was a mutiny; he was delivered
over to the commander of some Venetian galleys
and taken to Naples with his brother. The
Venetians gave him up to King Robert of Naples,
who put him and his brother into a dungeon in
the castle of Aversa, where they were left to die
of starvation. The company took service under
the French Duke of Athens.</p>

<p>Thasos is by far the most beautiful island in
the Archipelago. It has pleasant meads, wooded
glens, and picturesque mountain scenery. There
are many remains of ancient Greece, and on a
green hill rise the ruins of a fine old castle built
by the Genoese. In this delightful retreat Prince
Fernando rested for a few days after the troubles
and anxieties caused by his brief connection
with the company. He was joined by Ramon
Muntaner with his followers, who was devoted to
the House of Aragon.</p>

<p>In returning to Sicily they were attacked off
Negropont by a superior force of Venetians, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the Prince was taken prisoner. He was delivered
over to King Robert of Naples, who kept him
in captivity until, through the intervention of the
King of France, he was allowed to return to his
home in Majorca.</p>

<p>The next enterprise in which Prince Fernando
was engaged was against the Moors of Granada.
The King of Aragon agreed with Fernando IV.
(‘the Summoned’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>) of Castille to carry on this
war from two different directions. One was to
attack Almeria, while the other besieged Algesiras,
and there was a promise that neither should retire
without the consent of the other. The object
was to divide the Moslem forces. The Prince of
Majorca went with his cousin of Aragon to the
siege of Almeria. This seaport town, very beautifully
situated at the entrance of a fertile valley
backed by mountains, was a place of great commercial
importance in the days of the Beni Omeyya
Kh&acirc;lifas, and here they had their naval dockyard.
Almeria continued to flourish under the
Kings of Granada, and at one time it had kings
of its own. The siege lasted for nine months, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
the Aragonese brought with them all the artillery
of the day to batter the walls. Prince Fernando
was well fitted out by his father. He had under
his command a hundred Majorcan knights, many
foot soldiers, with galleys and <i>le&ntilde;os</i> to convey
the horses, provisions, and artillery. During the
siege Fernando proved himself to be a good knight
by his valorous deeds&mdash;‘One of the best knights
in the world,’ Muntaner says. Among other
combats, he had three hand-to-hand fights with
Moorish warriors, and won the palm of a good
knight in each encounter, in sight of both armies.</p>

<p>Fernando IV. (the Summoned One) broke his
word, raised the siege of Algesiras, and retreated.
This liberated a large Moorish force, which was
at once sent to Almeria. It was done without
informing the King of Aragon, who suddenly
found himself confronted by the whole power of
Granada. On the eve of St. Bartholomew a great
Moorish army suddenly attacked the besiegers.
The King of Aragon was surprised, but not dismayed.
He ordered Prince Fernando to remain
near the town with his contingent, at a place
called the ‘Esperonte’<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> of Almeria, to attack and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
drive back the besieged, if they sallied out to fall
upon the Aragonese rear while they were engaged
with the Moorish army in front. This was a most
honourable post, and Fernando held it gallantly.
The ‘Esperonte’ faced the seashore. While the
battle was raging a son of the Moorish King of
Guadix sallied forth at the head of a large force
with loud shouts and war-cries. Fernando was
well prepared. His men were formed to resist
attack. The Moor was one of the most famous
warriors of Granada. He was well in front,
scimitar in hand, shouting, ‘Ani ibn es-Sultan.’
‘What does he say?’ asked Fernando. ‘He says
that he is the King’s son,’ replied the interpreter.
‘If he is a King’s son, so am I,’ answered the
Prince; and, putting spurs to his horse, he
attacked the Moor. Before he could reach him
he had killed six of the enemy with his own hand,
breaking his lance on the sixth. He then drew
his sword and closed with the Moorish King’s son.
The Moor struck such a wonderful blow that he
cut off a quarter of the Prince’s shield, and again
shouted ‘Ani ibn es-Sultan.’ But the Prince delivered
such a blow that he cut open the Moor’s head
down to his teeth, and he fell dead. His followers
were routed, and few escaped back into the town.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the great Moorish army was entirely
defeated. The King of Aragon returned victorious
to his tent, to hear of the great service performed
by his cousin and of his deeds of derring-do,
equalling, says Muntaner, those of the famous
Roland. The King then raised the siege and
returned to Barcelona for three reasons. The
winter was approaching, the Castillian King had
broken faith, and he of Aragon had gained a
greater success by the liberation of many Christian
captives which he made a condition of his truce,
than if he had taken Almeria. Prince Fernando
joined his father and mother at Perpignan, who
rejoiced at his safe return.</p>

<p>En Fernando remained at home until he
heard that Robert of Naples, who had married
his sister Sancha, was making war on the King of
Sicily. Ever true to his cousin En Federigo, the
young Prince assembled his knightly followers,
and, with a good contingent of Majorcans, he
joined his cousin of Sicily. En Federigo was
delighted to see him, for they had not met since
En Fernando set out to join the company. The
King granted the Majorcan prince the city of
Catania for his life, and two thousand <i>onzas</i> a
year from his treasury. The cousins lived very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
happily together until King Robert of Naples
landed an army at Palermo and besieged Trapani.
Prince Fernando was sent to occupy Mount St.
Julian, where once stood the famous temple of
Venus, whence his <i>almogavares</i> gave a very bad
time to the besieging host. The King of Sicily
fitted out a large fleet of galleys to prevent any
escape, and then joined Prince Fernando on
Mount St. Julian, to attack the besiegers with a
superior force. At this critical juncture the
Dowager Queen of Naples, sister of Jayme II. of
Aragon, intervened, and a truce was arranged,
Robert of Naples surrendering all he had gained
and evacuating Sicily.</p>

<p>During the rest of his life Prince Fernando
was connected with the affairs of Greece. Long
before, the Duke of Burgundy and the Comte de la
Marche, grandsons of the King of France, had
invaded the Morea, driven out the Grecian rulers,
founded the city of Patras, and established the
French dukedom of Athens and principality of
the Morea. The Catalan company finally put
an end to the Athens dukedom by killing the
Comte de Brienne and all his nobles. In the
Morea, Louis, the fifth in descent from the Duke
of Burgundy, died without male heirs, but left two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
daughters. One inherited the Morea, and the
other the Barony of Matagrifon. One was married
to Felipe, a younger son of Charles of Anjou, and
the other to his friend the Count of Andria.
Felipe was recognised as Prince of the Morea, and
his friend as Baron of Matagrifon. Philip died
childless, and his widow married a Comte de
Nevers. The Count of Andria died, leaving a
daughter Isabel, who was unjustly deprived of
her inheritance. Her mother thought that there
was no knight in Christendom who would be
more likely to take up the cause of an injured
and dispossessed princess than En Fernando of
Majorca.</p>

<p>The mother, with her beautiful daughter,
came to Messina, where they were hospitably
received by the King of Sicily. Muntaner says
that Isabel was the fairest, the rosiest, the most
discreet maiden he had ever seen. The marriage
of En Fernando with the fair Isabel of Andria
took place at Messina, and, after several days of
festivity, the Prince took his bride to Catania.
Muntaner was then in command of the island of
Gerbes, on the African coast, but he at once
complied with a request that he should join
En Fernando. He arrived at Catania a few days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
before the Princess gave birth to a fine boy. He
brought with him great store of wedding presents,
consisting of richly embroidered dresses, slippers
of finely dressed leather, cloth of various colours,
and jewels. He spread them all out before the
Prince and Princess, to their great delight. The
birthday was on the first Saturday in April 1315.
The child received the name of Jayme in the
cathedral of St. Agatha at Catania.</p>

<p>There was a melancholy termination to the
bright prospect which seemed to open before the
young married pair. En Fernando had no sooner
completed his preparations to sail for the Morea
with a well-equipped force and recover his wife’s
dominions, than Isabel was seized with a fever
and died a month after the birth of her child.
She died in her husband’s arms, who was thus
plunged in grief and was long inconsolable. He
buried his bride under a monument near the tomb
of St. Agatha.</p>

<p>In sorrow the bereaved Prince commenced
his campaign. He was joined at Messina by the
faithful Ramon Muntaner, whose guidance as a
chronicler we are soon to lose. He had been
governor of the Isle of Gerbes for seven years, but
resigned that important appointment to share
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the fortunes of his beloved Prince. En Fernando
told Muntaner that he owed more to him than
to any other man on earth; but that he was now
going to ask him the greatest favour of all. The
little child at Catania was most in need of a valiant
defender. The Prince entreated Muntaner to give
up the campaign in the Morea and to convey his
motherless boy safely to its grandmother at
Perpignan. He would have letters to her, to
the King of Majorca, and to the Prince’s procurator,
En Berenguer Despuig, and he would be
supplied with well-fitted galleys for the voyage.
With a heavy heart Muntaner undertook the
charge, and took leave of the Prince who had won
his devoted affection.</p>

<p>Prince Fernando then made sail for the Morea
with a strong force of cavalry and of <i>almogavares</i>.
He landed near Clarencia, a small seaport on the
coast, south-west of Patras, and, after a feeble
resistance, captured the town. The people swore
allegiance to him, for Clarencia was part of his
wife’s inheritance. He then proceeded with the
conquest of the rest of the Morea, and when he
seemed well established he sent envoys to the
King of Cyprus, asking for the hand of his niece
Isabella. The marriage took place at Clarencia,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
and there was a son, named Fernando, born after
his father’s death.</p>

<p>Louis of Burgundy, who had married Mahault
of Hainault, Princess of Achaia, set out to dispute
the possession of the Morea with Prince
Fernando in 1315. Landing at Patras, he advanced
towards Clarencia, and Fernando came
out to meet him. There was a battle at a place
called Esfero on July 7, 1316, when the gallant
young Prince was slain. He had sent for reinforcements,
but his impetuosity prevented him from
waiting for them. Muntaner received the sad
news in Majorca, and declared that this was the
greatest loss the House of Aragon had ever sustained.
‘For,’ he added, ‘this was the best and
most valiant knight to be found among the sons
of kings in that age, the most just, and the one
who best knew how to order his actions.’ The
body was conveyed to Perpignan, and arrived
just after his mother’s death. The widow returned
to Cyprus, where her child was born.</p>

<p>But we must return to the orphan boy at
Catania. Having selected a galley of Barcelona
for the voyage, Muntaner chose an excellent
person as head nurse, a native of the Ampurdan,
named Na Ines de Adri, who was experienced in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
nursing, having had twenty-two children herself.
He also engaged a very robust young woman of
Catania as wet-nurse, and several maids. These
particulars are mentioned to show with what care
the old soldier entered upon his new duties. He
took with him attested proofs signed by those
who were present at the birth and baptism. On
the day appointed for sailing Muntaner left the
city with the infant in his arms, followed by
more than two thousand people. As he was
embarking, a messenger arrived from King
Federigo with two dresses of cloth of gold as a
present to his little cousin. On August 1, 1315,
Muntaner made sail from Catania. On arriving
at Trapani he received tidings that four galleys
were waiting for him, to seize the infant and thus
dispose of the heir to Clarencia and Matagrifon.
Muntaner therefore took more armed men on
board and waited to join a fleet of twenty-four
Catalan vessels. He then put to sea. After a
few days a storm raged so furiously that seven
ships sank and the rest were in great danger.
At length he let go his anchor in the port of Salou.
The child had never been out of his arms during
the whole time that the storm lasted, either by
night or day, the nurse being dreadfully seasick;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
nor could any of the other women stand on their
legs.</p>

<p>En Pedro de Rocaberti, the Archbishop of
Tarragona, sent good horses to Salou, and the
party went by easy stages to Barcelona, where
the King of Aragon received them with much
hospitality, kissing and blessing the little child.
Muntaner caused a litter to be made at Barcelona
for the nurse and child, which was borne on the
shoulders of twenty men; and so by very easy
stages they reached Perpignan in twenty-four
days. They proceeded to the castle, where the
Queens of Majorca then resided. When they
reached the gates Muntaner took the child in his
own arms and with great joy brought it into the
presence of its grandmother, who, with its aunt-in-law,
the reigning Queen, was seated to receive
it. ‘God,’ he exclaims, ‘does not give a greater
joy than that which my lady the Queen, its grandmother,
then felt on seeing the child so well
nurtured, with its face wreathed with smiles, and
its body wrapped in cloth of gold.’ Muntaner
knelt and kissed the hands of the two Queens,
making the child do the same. He declared that
this was the infant Jayme, son of the Prince En
Fernando and of Isabel his wife. Its grandmother
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
then took it in her arms and kissed it many times.
Soon afterwards the King of Majorca, who had
been in France, arrived at Perpignan, and very
joyfully received his nephew, making all the usual
rules and regulations for his being brought up as
if he was his own son.</p>

<p>It must have been a great relief to En Ramon
Muntaner to have performed this last and most
responsible duty for his beloved Prince. He had
been recruiting for him in Valencia and was in
Majorca, preparing to join him, when the sad news
of his death arrived. The kind old grandmother,
En Fernando’s mother, Esclaramunda de Foix,
died in the sane year. Alas! the good Muntaner
had preserved a life destined in the years to come
to more than the usual share of sorrow, misfortune,
and disaster. The child became the unhappy
Jayme III., last reigning King of Majorca, Count
of Roussillon, Cerda&ntilde;a, and Conflent, and Lord of
Montpellier. He was also Lord of Clarencia in
the Morea and of Matagrifon.</p>

<p>Besides little Jayme, Prince Fernando had three
illegitimate sons, named Fernando, Pagano, and
Sancho. They came to Majorca, and were ever the
loyal and devoted brothers and friends of their
young master Jayme, in prosperity and in adversity.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X<br />

<span class="medium table">King Sancho of Majorca</span></h2>

<p>Sancho, the second son of Jayme II., succeeded
as King of Majorca on June 4, 1311. He was a
just and peace-loving sovereign, beloved by his
people, always on excellent terms with his cousins
of Aragon, and he reigned prosperously for thirteen
years. Majorca was a feudatory of Aragon, with
the duty of assisting in the wars of the suzerain;
and the King was required to attend the Cortes
of the Aragonese kingdom to arrange the nature
and amount of aid to be contributed to the feudal
overlord.</p>

<p>As a boy Sancho had suffered imprisonment
with his brothers Felipe and Fernando, when
they were captured by the young tyrant
Alfonso III., first at Torrella de Monguin, then at
Gerona, and finally at Barcelona, where they were
released on Alfonso’s death. The misfortunes of
his boyhood were not continued in after-life.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
His reign was prosperous. On his accession he
swore to maintain the privileges and freedom
of his people; and the commerce of the island
made great progress under his fostering care.</p>

<p>Sancho married Maria, daughter of the Angevin
King of Naples, but had no children by her. They
both adopted the infant son of the chivalrous
younger brother Fernando. The King of Majorca
was in a position calling for much tact and diplomatic
skill on the one hand, and for energetic
defensive measures on the other. He had to be
well prepared against attacks of pirates from the
coasts of Barbary, to preserve his Continental
dominions from French encroachments, and to
maintain a good understanding with his cousin
of Aragon.</p>

<p>A fleet of armed ships was equipped for defence
against piratical attacks, half by the King and
half by the Jurados. It consisted of four galleys,
two galleots, and several smaller vessels. Later,
the <i>atalayas</i>, or watch-towers, were built along the
coasts, which gave notice of the approach of an
enemy by fire-signals. In 1316 King Sancho proceeded
from Perpignan to Avignon for an interview
with the Pope respecting French claims on
the Barony of Montpellier. The negotiations were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
transferred to Paris, and a satisfactory settlement
was arrived at. With Aragon Sancho continued
to maintain the most friendly relations. When
the conquest of Sardinia and Corsica was resolved
to be undertaken, he attended personally at the
Cortes held at Gerona in June 1322 as a feudatory
of Aragon. The result was that Majorca contributed
twenty new galleys to the expedition,
two hundred mounted knights, besides a contingent
of foot soldiers. King Jayme II. of Aragon
was so much pleased with this evidence of good
will on the part of his cousin of Majorca that he
expressed his satisfaction by exempting King
Sancho from the duty of personal attendance at
the Cortes of Aragon.</p>

<p>King Sancho built a castle for his residence
in the lovely ravine of Valdemosa, in the mountains
on the north-west coast, to the west of Soller.
From Palma the way is across the fertile <i>huerta</i>, or
garden, for eight miles, when the hilly region is
entered. There is terraced cultivation up the
mountain-sides with orange-trees and olives;
higher up, woods of Aleppo pines; and above them
the marble cliffs rise perpendicularly, their irregular
outline standing out against the blue sky. The
castle stood across the highest part of the pass, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
picturesque line of masonry rising from the groves
of orange and lemon trees. The first Alcaide, or
Castellan, of the castle of Valdemosa was Martin
de Muntaner, a relation of the chronicler. Here
King Sancho held his court, and here he enjoyed
hawking and other sports of the field. He had
a special breed of falcons, which was famous all
over Europe, and he introduced partridges into
the island. Beyond Valdemosa the scenery increases
in beauty as the sea on the north side of
the island comes in sight. Here was the college
founded by Jayme II. at the request of Raimundo
Lulio, but soon abandoned. King Sancho suffered
from asthma, and he found relief in the climate of
Miramar, passing much time in the building which
had been erected for an Arabic college. Far
below is the sea, the steep slopes descending to
it being covered with flowering shrubs and Aleppo
pines, while behind the marble cliffs shoot up
into peaks and ridges. His infirmity increasing,
Sancho was advised to try the climate of his
Continental dominions. The heat was very great
in the summer of 1324, and he retired to the cooler
air of the Pyrenees. There he died in the little
village of Santa Maria de Formiguera, in the
county of Cerda&ntilde;a, on September 4, 1324. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
King’s body was conveyed to Perpignan, where it
was interred in the church of San Juan.</p>

<p>Sancho left a will in the custody of his friend
Bernardo Truyolls. In it he declared his infant
nephew Jayme to be his heir, and appointed his
brother, the priest Felipe, to be Regent during the
minority. His widow, daughter of Charles II.
of Naples, married secondly Jayme, Lord of
Ezerica, son of another Jayme, the illegitimate
son of Jayme I. (the Conqueror).</p>

<p>Sancho was a wise and just sovereign, and
secured a period of peace and prosperity for the
islands and the islanders he loved so well.</p>

<p>There is a very rare gold coin of King Sancho,
a two-real piece, and a <i>dobler de potin</i>, the two
latter resembling those of Jayme II.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI<br />

<span class="medium table">King Jayme III. of Majorca</span></h2>

<p>The little child who was brought home with such
care and through so many dangers from Catania
now succeeded his uncle Sancho as Jayme III.,
King of Majorca, Count of Roussillon, Conflent, and
Cerda&ntilde;a, Lord of Montpellier, and, in his own
right, as the heir of his mother, Lord of Clarencia
in the Morea<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> and of Matagrifon.</p>

<p>Jayme had a happy childhood, and there was
no premonition of the sorrows and calamities of his
after-life. His clerical uncle Felipe was accepted
as Regent by the Ricos Hombres of Majorca and
the Cortes of Aragon, and, after some demur, by
Roussillon and Cerda&ntilde;a. The young King received
a good education under the supervision of En
Felipe, and was brought up with his elder half-brothers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
Fernando, Pagano, and Sancho, who
trained him in martial exercises. Among his
dearest friends was Arnaldo de Santa Cilia. This
noble and loyal Majorcan was the son of Pedro
Juan Santa Cilia, a knight of the conquest,
whose original home was a castle of the same
name on the banks of the river Ter, near Vich in
Catalonia. Pedro Juan married Leonor Ben-nasser,
the baptized heiress of the Arab chief Benahabet,
who helped King Jayme in the conquest. Through
her the Santa Cilias became the owners of the
beautiful country seat of Alfavia.</p>

<p>The Regent Philip continued the wise policy of
his brother. He took the boy King to Barcelona
to do homage to King Jayme II. of Aragon, and
furnished a strong contingent to his suzerain for
the Sardinian war. He also negotiated a marriage
between Jayme III. of Majorca and Constance,
the young granddaughter of the King of Aragon,
daughter of his heir Alfonso (who succeeded as
Alfonso IV. in 1327) by Teresa de Entensa of
Urgel.</p>

<p>Jayme III. was an amiable and gallant
prince, always loyal and correct in all his dealings
with his suzerain and beloved by his subjects.
Of his elder half-brothers, Fernando appears to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
have retired to Italy. But Pagano and Sancho
were his tutors in arms, counsellors, staunch and
loyal friends through life. Pagano was married
to Blanca, daughter of Ramon Sabellos, and
Sancho to Sauria, daughter of Ferrario Rossello.</p>

<p>All went well until the accession, in 1335, of
Pedro IV., son of Alfonso IV. and brother of
Constance, the wife of Jayme III. of Majorca.
She had another brother, Jayme, Count of Urgel,
a far better man. Pedro was an odious character.
Jayme III. came to Barcelona with his wife
Constance, and did homage to his brother-in-law
for his Balearic and Continental dominions,
proceeding thence to Perpignan. There he was
joined by Pedro, and the two Kings went together
to Avignon&mdash;Pedro to do homage to the Pope for
the new conquests of Sardinia and Corsica.</p>

<p>On his return to Aragon Pedro soon began to
show himself in his true character. From the
first he coveted the Balearic Islands, and resolved
to seize them in defiance of right and justice.
With such a man, a hatred of his unfortunate
brother-in-law and cousin, who stood in the way
of his ambition, was the inevitable consequence of
his greed.</p>

<p>Pedro IV. combined the evil qualities of our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
two Henry Tudors. He had all the avarice and
cunning meanness of the father and the heartless
cruelty of the son, together with his love of display
and magnificence. Hence he was called ‘Pedro
the Ceremonious.’ He soon began to seek for
excuses for his contemplated usurpation. His
first accusation was that the King of Majorca
allowed French money to circulate in his Continental
dominions, which he alleged to be derogatory
to his suzerainty. He then wrote letters to
the Jurados of Majorca, accusing their King of
contumacy. Their reply was that their King
had done nothing opposed to the dignity, honour,
or rights of the King of Aragon; but, on the
contrary, that he had complied with all his obligations
loyally and faithfully, and that they would
stand by him as devoted subjects. This reply was
dated June 18, 1342.</p>

<p>Jayme III. had returned to Majorca, and his son,
also named Jayme, was born in the Almudaina
in 1334. Isabel, his daughter, followed in 1338,
just when the dark clouds were gathering around
their father’s horizon.</p>

<p>Pedro found that the accusation about the
currency was absurd and untenable. He therefore
deliberately concocted an infamous lie, declaring
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
that his brother-in-law intended to kidnap him at
Barcelona and carry him off to a dungeon in
Majorca. He added that God, Who never failed
those that trusted in Him, had, by reason of
the piety and goodness of the Ceremonious one,
disclosed the treason.</p>

<p>A fleet was prepared at Barcelona for the
conquest of Majorca, and on February 21, 1343,
Pedro published what he called the sentence,
declaring the King of Majorca to be contumacious
and guilty of treason against his suzerain, and
that he was therefore deprived of all his dominions.
Jayme III., through his procurator Pedro Pascual,
published a complete refutation of the false statements
in the so-called sentence, and a well-reasoned
proof of his rights. Pedro’s aunt Sancha, the
Queen of Naples, entreated him to refrain from
hostilities and to let the questions be settled by
arbitration.</p>

<p>All was of no avail. On May 10, 1343, Pedro
embarked with 110 sail of vessels, 29 being war-galleys,
arriving on the coast of the island on
the 23rd. King Jayme had hastily collected some
troops to resist this unjust invasion. But they
were quickly routed by the vastly superior force
of the invaders, and the unfortunate King took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
ship and retired to Perpignan. There was a
great slaughter, and the city had no alternative
but submission. The usurper entered in triumph,
declaring Majorca and its dependent islands to
be annexed to the crown of Aragon. Nicolas de
Marin, the loyal castellan of Belver, held out for
a short time, but he was forced to capitulate.
A cruel persecution of all the friends of the King
of Majorca was then commenced. The Queen
and her two children were captured, and kept in
close imprisonment at Barcelona.</p>

<p>In July Pedro returned from Majorca, assembled
troops at Gerona, and prepared to attack his
brother-in-law’s Continental dominions. He advanced
to Figueras, where he received a letter
from the unfortunate Jayme asking for an interview.
The only reply was a threat that Perpignan
should be destroyed. But the town was faithful,
though Jayme was scarcely able to maintain the
troops that remained loyal to him. At last, in
January 1344, poor Jayme humbled himself to
the extent of entreating mercy from his coldblooded
and relentless brother-in-law. He submitted
entirely, in the hope of some feeling of
generosity or pity on the part of the usurper of
his dominions. But of any such feeling the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
Ceremonious one was quite incapable. He seized
upon Perpignan, and sent the King of Majorca
to Berga, where he was offered a pension on condition
that he abandoned all his rights of every
description. The object of Pedro was to drive
his brother-in-law to despair and exterminate his
family.</p>

<p>Jayme was indeed in despair. His wife, in
spite of her entreaties, was not allowed by her
unfeeling brother to join him. But the imprisonment
of the two innocent children was more than
some noble Catalans could stand. They broke
into the prison, killed the jailer, and contrived
that Prince Jayme and his sister should escape
to their father. At the same time there was a
revulsion of feeling in favour of the persecuted
King. The French Court interceded in his favour,
and he received letters and messages from Majorca
inviting him to return. He still retained the
Barony of Montpellier. He sold it to King Philip
of France for 120,000 <i>escudos de oro</i>, with which
he raised troops and equipped vessels for the
invasion of Majorca. The King of France and
the Queen of Sicily assisted him, especially with
ships. King Jayme collected eight galleys and
many smaller vessels, on board of which he embarked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
3,000 infantry and 400 cavalry. His half-brothers,
Pagano and Sancho, faithful to the end,
were with him. There, too, was his young son
Jayme, just escaped from the dungeon at Barcelona.
Carlos de Grimaldi, of the noble Genoese
family, was one of his chief commanders. He
had been granted the towns of Soller and Alcudia,
while his brother Ayto was to have the estate of
Bu&ntilde;ola, both with the title of Count. Thus the
ill-fated King sailed from the coast of Provence
on his last disastrous attempt to regain his
kingdom.</p>

<p>En Gilabert de Centelles was then Governor
of Majorca for the usurper, and he had a large
force under his command. King Jayme landed
with his little army on the south coast of the
island, and advanced with some hope of success.
But Centelles had an overwhelmingly superior
force of 20,000 infantry and 800 cavalry. The
hostile armies met near the town of Lluchmayor,
to the south-east of Palma. The King led a small
squadron of cavalry and some French infantry
in the van, and was the first to encounter the
enemy. But there was a panic, and his troops
fled in confusion. With only a few faithful
knights he fought valorously until, covered with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
wounds, he fell from his horse. When on the
ground a brutal soldier cut off his head. He had
reigned for twenty-five years, from 1324 to 1349,
the first eleven years happily and in peace, the
last fourteen bowed down by calamity and sorrow.
Jayme III. was a prince of many virtues. He
was conscientiously religious, well versed in the
learning of his time, animated and eloquent, and
devoted to the interests of his subjects. His
wife Constance was faithful to him throughout his
misfortunes, though long separated from him by
the heartless cruelty of her brother. His young
son loved him with a passionate fondness, which
led to his giving up his whole life to avenge
his father’s death. His half-brothers fought by
his side at Lluchmayor, and their wives were
thrown into prison. Sancho, the youngest, lead a
daughter named Esclaramunda, who married Antal,
Count of Foix, and was buried in the cathedral
of Palma.</p>

<p>For more than a hundred years the Aragonese
Kings of Majorca had ruled over the islands well
and prosperously and to the great good of the
inhabitants. They were an exceptionally noble
and high-souled race, worthy of their descent from
the ‘great Conquistador.’
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>The body of Jayme III. is said to have been
buried at Valencia. Born at Catania on April 5,
1315, his age was thirty-four and some months.
The fatal battle of Lluchmayor was on August 25,
1349.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII<br />

<span class="medium table">Relates the adventures of Jayme and Isabel, describes the memorial
chair, and records the end of the Majorcan dynasty</span></h2>

<p>Never did sovereign ascend a throne under such
appalling circumstances as did Jayme IV., the
last King of Majorca. The young Prince was
little more than fifteen years of age, yet he fought
by his father’s side and was severely wounded.
He was carried to Belver Castle by the side of
his father’s corpse. As soon as he was well enough
to be moved, he was again taken to Barcelona
and thrown into prison, where his uncle, the
Ceremonious one, intended him to rot and die.
The intercessions of his relations and of the Pope
were all useless.</p>

<p>There were people in Catalonia to whom this
tormenting of children was hateful and intolerable.
The escape was no easy task. The guards were
carefully chosen, and changed every week. The
prison was a disgrace to Pedro IV. as a place for
the confinement of an innocent relation. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
boy had to sleep in a sort of iron cage, and the
guards never left him by night or day. Jayme de
San Clemente, an official of the cathedral, was
shocked at the treatment of the young Prince.
He and a few friends succeeded in getting impressions
of the keys of the castle doors and in making
false ones; and they had the aid of some merciful
officials within. The rescuers killed Nicolas
Rovira, the captain of the guard, and liberated
the prisoner, who escaped out of Barcelona.
It does not appear where he was during the next
two or three years, but probably in some safe
refuge with his mother and sister. The brother
and sister were devoted to each other.</p>

<p>In 1362, the year when her second husband
died, a handsome youth appeared at the court of
Queen Juana of Naples. She fell in love with
him, and they were married in the same year.
This was Jayme IV., King of Majorca, who thus
became also King of Naples. Juana committed
many crimes, especially as regards her first husband;
but all may be condoned in consideration
of her unchanging loyalty and generosity to young
Jayme. The exiled King told his wife from the
first that his life must be devoted to the recovery
of his dominions and to avenge the cruel treatment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
of his father. With these objects he opened communications
with Pedro of Castille, who was at
enmity with his namesake, the Ceremonious one
of Aragon. Jayme, supported by funds supplied
by his Queen, joined the Black Prince, and distinguished
himself by his valour in the battle of
Najara.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the cause of Pedro of Castille
became hopeless. His illegitimate brother Henry
of Trastamara, aided by the Ceremonious tyrant
of Aragon, advanced into Spain with an army
and besieged the castle of Burgos, which had been
occupied by Jayme and his troops. The King of
Majorca made a gallant defence, but at last he
was obliged to surrender. His odious uncle of
Aragon tried to get his unfortunate nephew into
his clutches again; but love was ready to make
greater sacrifices than hatred. The Queen of
Naples ransomed her husband for sixty thousand
<i>doblas</i>.</p>

<p>In March 1369 Jayme was safe in the territory
of the Count of Foix. Thence he proceeded to
Avignon and began to collect troops, intending to
invade Roussillon, which had been unjustly occupied
by the usurper. His whole heart was devoted
to what he considered the duty of avenging his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
father’s death. He looked upon his uncle Pedro
as a usurper and murderer, and his hatred
for the Ceremonious one was intense. Friends
represented to him that he should be satisfied
with the kingdom of Naples and a devoted wife.
But he answered that he was bound to avenge his
father. When it was represented to him that
attacks with inadequate forces on so powerful an
enemy could only lead to his own destruction, he
replied that he could not die in a better cause.</p>

<p>The Companies were then overrunning France.
Young Jayme enlisted Englishmen, Frenchmen,
and Proven&ccedil;als, the funds being supplied by his
Queen. He advanced with his little army to
Narbonne, and thence to Toulouse. His beloved
sister Isabel, who had become the wife of the
Marquis of Monserrat, joined her brother when he
invaded his own territory of Roussillon. The town
of Perpignan was too strong for attack, and the
Ceremonious one was making great preparations
for the defence of Catalonia. His army was
assembled in the Ampurdan to oppose an entry
by the Pass of Panizas. The young King of
Majorca therefore crossed the Pyrenees, entering
by the Puig-cerdan Pass, and occupied the county
of Urgel. His uncle of Aragon resorted to a way
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
more in accordance with his nature than a fair
fight. He poisoned his nephew. The secret
crime was perpetrated at Valderan, near Urgel.
Jayme died in his sister’s arms, rendering up a
life which had been devoted to the memory of
his unhappy father. It was in January 1375
that the last King of Majorca and King Consort
of Naples expired within his own rightful dominions
of Cerda&ntilde;a. His body was buried in the Franciscan
monastery of Soria. His sister Isabel returned
into Gascony, and died in 1379, the last of her
race.</p>

<p>Pedro IV., the Ceremonious, after a turbulent
reign of fifty years, occupied chiefly in unjust
quarrels with his relations and neighbours, at last
died in 1396. His sons, Martin and Juan, were
rightful heirs to Majorca, the family of their
Majorcan cousins having become extinct. His
daughter Leonor, wife of Juan I. of Castille, was
the mother of Henry III. of Castille, and also of
Fernando (surnamed of Antequera from having
taken that town from the Moors), who, when the
male line of Aragon failed on the death of King
Martin, became King of Aragon.</p>

<p>An ancient and most touching memorial of
Jayme IV. and his sister Isabel is still preserved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
at Alfavia by the descendants of their true and
faithful friends of the Santa Cilia family. The
estate was held by the Santa Cilia family for five
generations, when the heiress Leonor married
Gabriel de Berga. The heiress of Berga married
Zaforteza, and Don Jos&egrave; Burguez Zaforteza is
now the owner of Alfavia and guardian of the
relic.</p>

<p>The country seat of Alfavia, at the foot of the
mountain pass leading to the valley of Soller, is
surrounded by enchanting scenery. In front there
are two fir-clad mountain-peaks, with just a peep
between them of the garden of Palma, the cathedral,
and the blue Mediterranean. All round there are
precipitous mountains, the lower slopes in terraces
planted with lemon and orange trees. The
beautiful garden is famous for a long pergola
covered with flowing creepers, having a fountain
in each arch on either side. The entrance to the
courtyard is by a wide and lofty passage, and the
first compartment of its roof is a reminder of the
Moorish origin of the house. It is a dome in the
style of the roofs at the Alhambra, the colours
still visible. Round the margin, or cornice, there
is an Arabic inscription, which has been thus
translated:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span></p>

<p>‘Precept is of God: power is of God: mercy is
of God: God is most great, there is no God but
Him: wealth consists in God.’</p>

<p>On the walls of the passage the coats-of-arms
are painted of the families which have owned
Alfavia since Moorish times:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">I.</td>
    <td>Ben nassar (<i>or a lion rampant gules</i>).</td>

  </tr>
</table>

<p>But the great treasure of Alfavia is the memorial
of the unfortunate brother and sister, Jayme IV.
and Isabel. It consists of a solid oaken armchair
of the fourteenth century, designed and carved
for Arnaldo de Santa Cilia in loving memory of
his ill-fated friends. The workmanship and the
costumes of the figures carved on it are the evidence
of its date. The carvings represent the sorrows
of the two unfortunate children of Jayme III.
On each end of the back there are lions s&eacute;jant.
On the back, facing the seat, two figures are carved,
a prince and a lady, in costumes of the fourteenth
century. They are seated at a table, supposed
to be a chessboard, but the surface is smooth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
A small dog is under the table. Over them there
is a tree with three branches, and foliage at the
end of each. On each branch, among the foliage,
there is a bird of evil omen or of mourning&mdash;crows
and owl&mdash;symbolising the sorrows of the two
young people beneath them. Below the seat
there are two fierce bloodhounds facing each other,
one killing a rabbit.</p>

<p>At the back of the chair the carving is still
more symbolical. A laurel-tree rises out of a
tomb, and among its foliage there is a crowned
head, intended for that of Jayme III. On either
side of the tree stand the same prince and princess,
the prince with a hawk on his wrist. Both
point their hands down to the tomb, in which
there is the same crowned head.</p>

<p>In a lower compartment there is a fierce
hound chasing a rabbit; and beneath that again
there is a rabbit sitting up and looking back
behind a mound, a second mound with a rabbit
looking out of it, and the hindquarters of another
going into its hole. On the sides of the chair
there are niches with arches, and under two of
them on either side are armed figures in iron caps,
shirts of mail, swords, and shields. One is crowned
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
and has a long mantle, and a bird with wings
displayed is carved on his shield.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>The whole composition is very curious and
most interesting, alike a touching memorial of
the brother and sister, the last of their race, and
a very precious relic of antiquity.</p>

<p>The descendants of the second son of Jayme
the Conqueror have left a goodly record. To
them Majorca owed her rights and liberties, the
settlement of her people, the founding of her
towns, and all the beginnings of her future prosperity.
Devoted to the good of their people,
honourable and true to their word, wise in counsel,
steadfast in adversity, they produced also knights-errant
of the most chivalrous type, like En Fernando
and like young Jayme IV., the last of his race.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<span class="medium table">Relates the story, so far as it concerns Majorca, of the last
Kings of Aragon</span></h2>

<p>The extinction of their reigning dynasty was a
great calamity to the people of Majorca, especially
during the prolonged life of the Ceremonious one.
At last he died in 1387. His sons were very
different in all respects. Juan I., surnamed the
Huntsman, succeeded as King of Aragon, and he
was also the legitimate heir to the Balearic Islands.
A pestilence in Catalonia led him to visit Majorca.
He and his Queen were in different galleys,
and were separated during bad weather. Juan
landed at Soller on July 16, 1394, and proceeded
to the castle of Valdemosa. The Queen, reached
Palma safely. They were united at the castle of
Belver, where they spent six pleasant months.
Devoted to the chase, Juan went about over the
island hawking the partridges introduced by King
Sancho. He also imported deer. Returning to
Aragon, he was unfortunately killed in the forest
of Fox&agrave;, near his castle of Uriols, when hunting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
a she-wolf. He only had a daughter named
Violante, who became Queen of Naples, mother
of Louis, Duke of Calabria.</p>

<p>Juan I. was succeeded by his brother King
Martin, an excellent prince, surnamed ‘the
Humane.’ At this time San Vicente Ferrer of
Valencia was flourishing and striving to create a
religious revival, and his zeal made an impression
on the minds of King Martin and many of his
subjects. In 1413 San Vicente went to Majorca,
where his preaching aroused the people to make
great demonstrations of their religious fervour.
It is even said that the saint wrought a miracle
by bringing down abundant rain during a season
of drought. The Catholic zeal of King Martin
led him to grant Sancho’s castle of Valdemosa
to the Carthusians for a monastery on June 15,
1399. Large donations for the building of the
church were received from Majorcan nobles, and
the courtly apartments of King Sancho were
converted into cells, a refectory, and a cloister.
The Cartuja of Valdemosa continued to flourish
on this beautiful site for more than four centuries.
The church is a fine edifice, containing the richly
carved stalls of the Carthusians, a profile in relief
of King Martin, and a remarkably good statue,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
carved in wood, of St. Bruno. After the suppression
and the expulsion of the Carthusians in
1834 their cells were let to families from Palma
and others for the summer. A large portion forms
the summer residence of Don Juan Sureda, who
has converted the refectory into a charming ballroom,
with a stage and proscenium at one end for
private theatricals. Georges Sand, with the composer
Chopin, occupied two of the cells. Georges
Sand afterwards wrote a book on her winter residence
in Majorca in 1835, animadverting on the
country and the people. But her strictures are
unfair and, to a great extent, untrue, and have
been ably refuted by a native author. To this
day the Cartuja on its ridge, surrounded by
orange-groves, is a beautiful object in the ascent
from the garden of Palma to Valdemosa, still
looking more like the castle of King Sancho than
a Cartuja. Apartments are shown as having
been the residence of King Martin, but he never
visited the island personally.</p>

<p>Martin died in 1410 without legitimate children,
and there were several claimants to the
succession. The Count of Urgel represented the
male line, as the grandson of Jayme, brother of
Pedro IV. Fernando of Antequera, brother of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the King of Castille, was a nephew of King Martin
through his mother, Leonor. Louis of Calabria
was a grandson of Juan I. and grand-nephew of
King Martin. Alfonso, Duke of Gandia, was a
nephew of Alfonso IV. and first cousin of Pedro IV.
There was also Fadrique, Count of Luna, an
illegitimate son of King Martin. Altogether five
claimants. Elected delegates from Aragon, Catalonia,
Valencia, and Majorca were assembled to
examine the claims. There was a strong feeling
in favour of the Count of Urgel, as representing
the male line; but Fernando de Antequera was
chosen, it is supposed through the influence of
San Vicente Ferrer. Fernando I. only reigned for
four years, from 1412 to 1416, and was succeeded
by his son Alfonso V., who devoted a long reign
of forty-two years chiefly to the conquest of
Naples. He was surnamed ‘the Magnanimous.’</p>

<p>The Majorcans gave King Alfonso assistance
in soldiers and in ships, and many of their knights
served in the King’s campaigns. Both the Government
and private persons co-operated with Barcelona
in fitting out armed ships for the protection
of trade against the Barbary pirates. Among the
Majorcan nobles who equipped such vessels the
foremost was En Salvador Sureda, who also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
appeared at this time as a knight of chivalry
under the following circumstances.</p>

<p>A Catalan knight named Francisco de Valseca,
who was famous for his prowess in all jousting
exercises, came to Palma to take part in a tournament
in 1442. He ran a lance with Salvador
Sureda, and censured his opponent for the way
in which he had gained an advantage. Sureda
replied that he had used his lance and run the
course as became a knight, and that he was ready
to encounter his adversary again as often as he
liked and at any place he might appoint. Valseca
did not hear these words because his vizor was
down, and he was not told of them until after his
return to Barcelona. He then promptly sent a
trumpet to Sureda, challenging him to a combat.
The two knights sent a joint request to the King,
Alfonso V. of Aragon, that he would appoint
lists and preside at the encounter. The King
consented, naming his city of Naples as the place
and summoning the combatants to appear there
on a certain day. The royal missive was sent
to Sureda, who, on August 23, 1443, sent his
trumpet, named Agustin de Luna, with two letters&mdash;one
of thanks to the King; the other, with
a copy of the royal letter, to Valseca. The trumpet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
sailed from Porto Pi and duly delivered the letters.
The day appointed was January 5, 1444.</p>

<p>Both knights proceeded to Naples and made
their appearance on the appointed day. En
Salvador Sureda wore a crimson surcoat embroidered
with gold, and his horse was similarly
caparisoned. His device was a small falcon’s
cage, with the motto ‘dentro est&aacute; quier le cage.’
He was preceded by three knights richly dressed,
and three pages with the helmet and plumes. The
route along which he came was kept by several
friends, bearing the well-known Majorcan names
of Dameto, Zaforteza, Bosch, Mari, and Vivot.
In advance of all was a herald, with trumpets
and minstrels and the Sureda standard, which
was a cork-tree on a golden ground. Valseca also
came splendidly accoutred and similarly attended.</p>

<p>At each end of the lists there were tents for
the combatants, and on the side a very richly
ornamented pavilion for King Alfonso and his
young son Fernando, of whom the King was very
fond. Ten knights, called the ‘ten faithful ones,’
guarded the lists, and two others, nominated by
the King, were named ‘preservers of peace.’ At
least twenty thousand spectators were present.</p>

<p>There was complete silence, until a clarion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
sounded and the two knights came out of their
tents and mounted. On a second blast of the
clarion the two knights put their lances in rest
and commenced their furious careers. At that
moment the King threw his warder down, as our
poor Richard II. had done some fifty years before,
but with very different consequences. The ‘ten
faithful ones’ then rushed between the combatants
and wrested their lances from them.
Their astonishment was mingled with anger not
immediately appeased. Young Fernando then
came down from the pavilion and called the two
knights, who had dismounted. He told them
that the King his father was unwilling that either
knight should be killed, both being so distinguished
and both having sufficiently proved their
fortitude, resolution, and valour. Valseca and
Sureda both placed themselves under the orders
of the King. The young Prince took a position
himself between the two, and, taking a hand of
each, he led them up to King Alfonso, at whose
feet they knelt and did homage. The King
obliged them to make friends, conferred several
benefits on them, and the day ended in rejoicing
and festivities. The standard of Sureda was hung
in the cathedral of Palma. There it remained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
until 1819, when it was burnt at the fire of the
ancient chapel of San Pedro.</p>

<p>Alfonso V. had achieved the conquest of
Naples, though he lost his brother Pedro during
the siege. When he died, in 1458, his illegitimate
son Fernando succeeded as King of Naples,
followed by his sons Alfonso and Federigo. On
their deaths Naples became part of the vast
dominions of Fernando of Aragon and Castille.
Thus Alfonso V. restored all the dominions of
King Manfred to his descendants.</p>

<p>The conqueror of Naples was succeeded as
King of Aragon by his brother Juan II., a very
different man. Juan had married Blanche, the
heiress of Navarre, by whom he had a son Carlos,
Prince of Viana, and a daughter Leonor. Juan II.
began to persecute his son in 1450, before his
accession, and when he was only King of Navarre
by right of his wife. Carlos, when he came of age,
felt that he was the rightful King of Navarre, and
not his father. He took up arms, was defeated,
and taken prisoner. He was confined in the
castle of Monroy, but he escaped to Naples, and
after the death of his uncle Alfonso he took refuge
in Sicily. Juan II. sent an envoy to induce the
Prince of Viana to come to Majorca, where he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
landed in August 1459, and was very cordially
received by the people. Juan II. published an
order that all the castles in Majorca were to be
delivered over to the Prince; but he sent a secret
order at the same time that some of the strongest,
including the castle of Belver, were not to be given
up, and that Carlos was to be detained if he entered
Belver. Knowing that the word of his father
could not be depended upon, and fearful of arrest,
the Prince resolved to proceed to Barcelona and
seek an interview. He landed on March 20, 1460,
and his father pretended to be reconciled, fearing
insurrections in his son’s favour; but the Prince
of Viana died, under very suspicious circumstances,
in the following year. His sister Leonor then
became Queen of Navarre, and by her marriage
with Gaston de Foix the title descended to
Henry IV., and again became merged in the
crown of France.</p>

<p>Juan II. had married secondly Juana Henriquez,
daughter of the Admiral of Castille, and by her he
had a son Fernando, and a daughter Juana, Queen
of Naples. After a reign of twenty years Juan II.
died, and was succeeded by his son Fernando II.
in 1479. The marriage of Fernando with Isabella
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of Castille united the two kingdoms, and Majorca,
with the other islands, became a part of the
kingdom of Spain. But Majorca retained her
constitution and privileges during the sway of
the Austrian dynasty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span></p>

<span class="medium table">The Majorcans as navigators</span></h2>

<p>The intelligence and energy of the Catalans of
Barcelona and Majorca, combined with their
industry and perseverance, raised the kingdom
of Aragon to a very important position as a maritime
Power in the Mediterranean. Long the rivals
of the Genoese, the Catalans at one time gained
complete ascendency. Their fleets dominated the
western half of the great inland sea, with Sicily,
Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, and the Balearic Islands
either under the sovereignty or in close alliance
with the Kings of Aragon. Their trading vessels
frequented the Levant and the &AElig;gean Sea, and
Catalan consulates and factories were established
in Macedonia, in Greece, and on the islands.
Voyages were even undertaken beyond the Pillars
of Hercules.</p>

<p>The seamen of Majorca were as energetic and
expert as those of the mainland, and Palma had
a great dockyard and arsenal where galleys of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
thirty benches were built. But the success of the
Catalans depended more on their skill and superior
knowledge of navigation than on the size and
number of their ships. In the middle of the
fourteenth century the marine service of Majorca
consisted of 30,600 sailors, manning 460 vessels,
of which twenty-four were of the largest size,
and the others were used for carrying merchandise.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>
Palma could fit out a contingent of large ships
as part of the armed fleet of Aragon, and the
safety of trade was provided for both by the
Government and by private enterprise. Salvador
de Sureda was not the only Majorcan notable who
fitted out a ship at his own expense to resist the
incursions of Barbary pirates.</p>

<p>The natives of Majorca were for a long time
the leading geographers, inventors of instruments,
and constructors of marine charts in Europe.
They used the magnetic needle long before its
supposed discovery by Gioia of Amalfi, and they
could find the polar distance. The rudeness of
their instruments increases the merit of the results
obtained with them. Their <i>portolani</i>, or marine
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
charts, were far more accurate than any of the
maps even of a later period. They were in constant
use before 1359, when every galley was
ordered to carry two charts for navigation.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>
Several Catalan <i>portolani</i> have been preserved.
The most interesting, though not the oldest, is
now in the possession of the Count of Montenegro
at Palma. It was drawn in 1439 by Gabriel de
Valseca, who in his own hand wrote the following
inscription on it: ‘gabriell de ualsequa la feta en
Malorcha an MCCCCXXXVIIII.’ It once belonged
to Amerigo Vespucci, as an inscription on
the back testifies: ‘questa ampia pelle di geografia
fue pagata de Amerigo Vespucio CXX
ducati di oro di marco.’ It was bought at Florence
in the eighteenth century by Cardinal Despuig,
to form part of the library of his nephew, the
Count of Montenegro. A facsimile was made for
the Spanish Government at the time of the
Columbus anniversary, and now hangs in the
museum of the Ministry of Marine at Madrid.</p>

<p>A curious accident happened to this priceless
geographical document in 1839. Georges Sand
obtained leave to see it. Up to that time the
stiff parchment had been rolled up in a tin case.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
It was brought out and spread on a table. The
famous novelist, to keep it down, took up an
inkstand and placed it on the edge of the map.
But the parchment, which had been rolled up for
centuries, was too strong. It flew back and the
ink was upset. Georges Sand, horrified at what
she had done, ran straight out of the house.
Luckily the injury was not serious, and is confined
to the part outside the Mediterranean.
The precious map now has a room to itself in the
Montenegro palace at Palma. It is framed and
glazed on both sides, and kept in a locked case
covered with crimson velvet.</p>

<p>The outline of the Mediterranean is almost
exactly correct. The lines of the Valseca <i>portolano</i>
placed over the coast-lines of a modern chart
correspond very nearly, especially the western
part. Italy is slightly out in longitude. The
Valseca <i>portolano</i> includes Great Britain, Ireland,
Jutland, the Euxine and Persian Gulf, and the
Red Sea painted bright red. The chart is covered
with rhumb-lines. The Nile is separated into
two, one taken through Abyssinia and the other
away to the Niger region. There are kings on
their thrones, and every country has its arms
painted on flags. The golden shield of Aragon,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
with its four pales gules, flies over Aragon,
Majorca, Sardinia, and Sicily. It is interesting
to see the south of Spain painted green, for the
Moors were still at Granada. There are several
legends in minute handwriting on the map.
Majorca may well be proud of having in her
island in this priceless map the most valuable and
interesting geographical document of the fifteenth
century. Next to it comes the <i>mapa mondi</i> of
Jayme Cresques, also of Catalonian origin, and
now in the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale of Paris.</p>

<p>The fame of the geographers of Majorca, for
their profound knowledge as navigators and skill
as cartographers, spread over Europe. When
Prince Henry founded his celebrated school for
pilots at Sagres, as an essential part of his plans
for the discovery of the African coast, he found
no one more competent to direct it than ‘Maestro
Jacome de Mallorca,’ a most able navigator and
constructor of nautical instruments. But the
Majorcan sailors did not confine themselves to
these important studies, nor to cruises in the
Mediterranean. They undertook voyages beyond
the Pillars of Hercules in very early times. On
August 10, 1346, Jayme Ferrar set sail from Palma,
passed through the Straits, and coasted along
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Africa as far as the mouth of the Rio del Oro, five
degrees south of that Cape Nun which the Portuguese
did not round until 1419.</p>

<p>The commercial prosperity of Majorca, derived
from the enterprise of her sailors, led to the building
of the <i>Lonja</i>, or Exchange, which is still one of
the chief architectural ornaments of Palma. The
architect was Guillem Sagrera, who also built the
Castel Nuovo at Naples for Alfonso V.; and the
work was undertaken by the principal merchants
of Palma. Finished in 1450, it consists of a lofty
hall with a groined roof supported by six tall
slender pillars. The doorway is very richly
carved in the style of the north door of the cathedral,
and at each angle of the edifice there is a
statue of a saint under a stone canopy: San
Nicolas in the angle facing Porto Pi, in the opposite
niche San Juan Bautista, in the angle looking
towards the Ataranza (arsenal) Santa Catalina,
and Santa Clara looking towards the Almudaina.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>
Here was the centre of commercial transactions
during the Middle Ages, while the wharves outside
formed an active and busy scene, the ceaseless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
ebb and flow of Mediterranean trade. The
commercial ventures were not without danger,
the piratical States of Barbary continuing their
raids and depredations quite into modern times.</p>

<p>Barbarossa infested the seas and caused such
havoc that the Emperor Charles V. undertook
punitive expeditions to Tunis in 1535 and to
Algiers in 1541. On the latter occasion he landed
at Alcudia, and proceeded thence to Palma on
October 13. He was received with great demonstrations
of joy by all the chief people of the
island, Nicolas Cotoner and Pedro Juan de Santa
Cilia, bearers of most ancient names, walking
by his horse to the cathedral, where Mass was
said. The Emperor was received in the Almudaina,
and Leonardo Zaforteza superintended the
arrangements for lodging the other guests. Charles
departed on the 18th, taking with him a hundred
Majorcan knights who joined his expedition. But
the elements were against them, and the invasion
of Algiers ended in failure.</p>

<p>The Moors were not slow to retaliate. Two
years afterwards five hundred of them landed at
Pollenza, but were repulsed with heavy loss.
Several other descents were made on the island
by Dragut and his subordinate corsairs, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
there was much hard fighting, with slaughter on
both sides, but serious loss of unfortunate people
carried off into slavery. It was in September 1552
that Valdemosa was attacked by the crews of the
Algerine galleots. About five hundred Moors landed
in the night and entered the town without opposition.
Loading themselves with spoils and taking
four hundred captives with them, they began their
retreat to the ships. Raimondo Gual had command
of only thirty-five men at Valdemosa.
Open resistance would have been futile; still, he
watched his opportunity. In a narrow pass, since
called ‘P&agrave;s dels M&ograve;ros,’ he made a sudden attack
on the retreating pirates, who were panic-stricken,
and very few escaped. No quarter was given to
them. Their banner was hung up in the parish
church. Valdemosa was again unsuccessfully
attacked by the Moors in 1582.</p>

<p>Next it was the turn of the town of Andraix,
at the south-west end of the island, which was
attacked by twenty-four piratical vessels in 1553.
The inhabitants fled, some taking refuge in a
small castle. Don Jorge Fortu&ntilde;y, a neighbouring
proprietor, put himself at the head of a small body
of cavalry, and his name alone led the invaders to
make a hasty retreat to their ships. But Andraix
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
was attacked and pillaged in 1555, and again in
1578.</p>

<p>In 1561 a piratical expedition was fitted out
at Algiers, consisting of twenty-two vessels, under
the command of a renegade named Ochali, to
attack the town of Soller. Measures were taken
for its defence, and troops arrived under a commander
named Miguel Angelats. Fearing the
fortress at the port of Soller, the pirates landed at
a place called ‘Coll de la Illa’ 1,700 men in two
divisions. One division marched to the port,
while the other advanced by the bridge of <i>Binibaci</i>
to attack the town. Angelats had left the town,
leading his troops to oppose the landing, but was
too late. Thus the Moors entered and pillaged
Soller without opposition. But the Majorcans
returned with all speed and, in a desperate fight,
completely routed the pirates, who lost at least
five hundred of their number. Don Guillem de
Rocafull, the Viceroy of Majorca, hurried across
the island with succour, and found that the victory
was already won.</p>

<p>There were other piratical raids on the island,
showing the great need for vigilance and for a
protecting fleet. But the maritime power was
not so strong or efficient in the sixteenth century
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
as it had been in the more flourishing times when
the Aragonese kings reigned and so successfully
promoted the maritime eminence of their subjects.
Nevertheless, the sailors of Majorca continued to
maintain the fair fame of their ancestors, and
have done so to the present day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV<br />

<span class="medium table">The Comunidades</span></h2>

<p>The rising of the people of Spain against their
rulers coincided in point of time with the accession
of the Austrian dynasty in the person of
Charles V. In the Castilles it was a very noble
attempt of the towns, under the leadership of
patriots such as Padilla, to preserve the constitutional
liberties of the people. It failed, but the
best feeling of the country will always look back
to it with approval and with pride. The picture
of the execution of Padilla now has an honoured
place in the hall of the Cortes at Madrid, and the
story of the Comunidades of Castille has occupied
the pen of one of Spain’s most accomplished
historians.</p>

<p>But in the risings of so-called Comuneros in
Valencia and in Majorca there is no such noble
story to tell. These were mere insurrections of
artisans and peasantry, goaded on by the violent
harangues of leaders as ignorant as themselves,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
without fixed aims or objects, and influenced only
by envy and jealousy of those who were placed
above them. From Valencia the contagion spread
to Majorca in 1521. The people, called <i>pageses</i>,
and inhabitants of the country towns, complained
that the nobles, living in their palaces at Palma,
oppressed them with taxes and misgoverned the
country. The insurrection began with a meeting
of artisans in a house near the church of San
Nicolas in Palma, where an inflammatory speech
was addressed to them by a man named Juan
Crespi. The movement rapidly spread, and came
to the notice of the Viceroy, Don Miguel de Gurrea.
He called a meeting of officials, but the only
result was the arrest of a shoemaker named Pedro
Begur and three others. The Viceroy had no
sufficient force at his command, and the arrests
only infuriated the mob, who flew to arms and
liberated the prisoners. The Viceroy then rode
through the streets with some attendants, calling
on the rioters to disperse, and promising to listen
to their complaints. The insurgents then occupied
the public buildings, seized all the arms they
could find, and chose Juan Crespi to be their
captain. This was in the end of January 1521.
Crespi’s title was ‘Instador del beneficio comun’;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
and the Viceroy, to gain time, actually issued a
decree conferring it upon him. In February both
the Viceroy and the insurgents sent letters to the
King, giving different versions of what had taken
place. In March the insurgents had organised
a force of 1,800 men and had got possession of all
the gates of the city. Many of the nobles were
killed, and the rest escaped to Alcudia, a fortified
town. The Viceroy escaped to the island of
Ivi&ccedil;a.</p>

<p>The Jurados, consisting of Juan de Puigdorfila,
Jayme Marti, and two others, were allowed
to remain in office nominally; but fifteen ‘Conservadores’
were elected by the insurgents to
introduce the reforms they demanded. In April
a reply came from the King to the ‘Instador’
and the ‘Conservadores,’ ordering them to obey
the Viceroy, who would do them justice. They
declared the letter to be a forgery, and proceeded
to acts of violence, beheading all who openly
opposed them. The movement spread to the
country towns, and the loyal people were in a
state of terror. Some of the nobles had taken
refuge in the castle of Belver, under the protection
of Pedro Pax, the castellan. On July 29
the insurgents began the siege of the castle, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
was gallantly defended until all the ammunition
was expended. The place was then taken by
assault. The insurgents beheaded the castellan
and several others. The castle was gutted and
left in charge of three men to guard it.</p>

<p>There is a long list of nobles who were put to
death at Palma, including a Cotoner, five Puigdorfilas,
and a Despuig. Pedro Juan Zaforteza
took refuge in Valdemosa, whence he escaped, in
the disguise of a friar, to Alcudia, where the rest
of the nobles had taken refuge. In November
1521 the insurgents formed an army of six
thousand men, including cavalry, and six siege
pieces, to lay siege to Alcudia. The town was
surrounded on November 20, 1521, the besiegers
being busy constructing scaling ladders and a
battery for their artillery. The nobles made a
very resolute sally, capturing the battery with
its guns and stores, which disheartened the besiegers,
upwards of a hundred being killed.
Antonio Sureda especially distinguished himself
in this sally, and the hopes of the besieged rose
high. Pedro Pax, son of the castellan of Belver,
was chosen to command at Alcudia. He found
that provisions were running short, and resolved to
attack the enemy with his whole force, numbering
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
1,080. The battle was long contested, but at
last the insurgents broke and fled, thus raising
the siege. Their provisions and stores were captured,
and the scaling ladders and other siege
appliances were burnt.</p>

<p>In August Charles V. sent Dr. Francisco
Ubaque as Regent to restore order, the Viceroy
being still in the island of Ivi&ccedil;a. He landed at
Alcudia. The insurgents were then in occupation
of the neighbouring town of Puebla. They resumed
the siege of Alcudia in September, but
they were again repulsed after a very desperate
attempt to carry the place by assault.</p>

<p>The Emperor was at Brussels, and at last he
was induced to attend to the deplorable condition
of Majorca. An expedition was ordered to
be fitted out in the Catalonian ports to restore
order and punish the delinquents. Four large
galleys, thirteen ships, and several smaller vessels
were fitted out, and 1,200 men were embarked
under the command of Don Francisco Carroz and
Don Juan Velasco. The expedition first went to
Ivi&ccedil;a to embark the Viceroy, Don Miguel de
Gurrea or Urrea.</p>

<p>On October 15 the fleet entered the port of
Pollenza. The rescuers were received with great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
joy at Alcudia, where the Viceroy proclaimed a
general pardon to those who laid down their arms
and returned to obedience. Many came in, surrendering
under the terms of the proclamation;
but others held out. At Palma there was great
confusion, the Bishop, Dr. Pont, working incessantly
to induce the people to submit.</p>

<p>At Pollenza the insurgents made a desperate
resistance and there was great slaughter, no
quarter being given. Very few escaped to the
mountains. On November 5 the Viceroy, with
all the chief officers and three thousand soldiers,
left Alcudia and advanced to Puebla, where they
only found two labourers and a priest. Other
towns were found without inhabitants. At Inca
the people came out with their priests to meet the
Viceroy, singing a <i>Te Deum</i>. On March 1, 1523,
the Viceroy invested Palma with his army. Priamo
de Villalonga had held out in the castle of the
Templars, then called the Royal Castle, for many
months. He was now relieved, and this disastrous
insurrection approached its end.</p>

<p>The last act of this melancholy drama was
performed and described by young Don Alonzo
Enriquez de Guzman in his very entertaining
autobiography. He was ordered by the Viceroy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
of Valencia to take command of five hundred
men, and to sail from Murviedro, to reinforce the
army that was employed in re-establishing order
in Majorca. But the five hundred men refused
to embark until they had received their arrears
of pay. After a great deal of trouble he at length
persuaded them to go on board, and they sailed
to join the army in Majorca in nine small vessels.
Arriving off Palma at nightfall, Don Alonzo, a
young man in his twenty-third year, but with an
amount of self-assurance beyond his age, announced
the arrival of a very important reinforcement.
The report was spread that his force consisted of
five thousand men. Captain Crispin, the leader
of the rebels, came out of the town with a guard
of fifty men and sought speech with Don Alonzo.
He besought the young commander to mediate
between him and the Viceroy and induce him to
consent to a deputation being sent to the Emperor.
He proposed that, while the deputies were going
and coming, Don Alonzo should remain in the city
with thirty men, Crispin promising to deliver the
place to whomsoever the King should command.</p>

<p>Don Alonzo, with the approval of the Viceroy,
agreed to this and entered the city, the Viceroy’s
army being encamped outside. After a month
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
the deputies returned, reporting that the Emperor
had listened to them every day for two hours
during eight days, and that they were very well
satisfied. Nine days afterwards an order came to
Don Alonzo from the Emperor, and another from
the Viceroy, which were delivered to him through
the closed gates. The Emperor instructed him
to obey the Viceroy. The order of the Viceroy
was that he should seize the person of Crispin
and those of the thirteen members of his Council,
and open the gates at four o’clock that afternoon,
being March 7, 1522. If the people would not let
him do so, he was to come out himself.</p>

<p>The orders came to Don Alonzo at ten in the
forenoon. He at once proceeded to the Plaza de
Cort, where he found Crispin with his guards and
five of his councillors. He told them that he had
received orders to deliver up the city to Don
Miguel de Urrea, the Viceroy, and expressed a
hope that they would keep faith and give evidence
to the Emperor that they were honest men.
Crispin replied that he would be the first to obey
the orders of his Majesty. The rest all said the
same.</p>

<p>Don Alonzo then went to dinner in the Almudaina,
and each man departed to his own house.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
After dinner he called an assembly, ordering no
one to bring his arms. Then, with many kind
words, he put Crispin and all his councillors in
irons. This manœuvre having been safely accomplished,
he formed processions, with all the women
and children barefooted on one side and all the
men barefooted on the other, and made them go
to the gates and open them, with loud cries for
mercy. The Viceroy and Don Juan de Velasco
entered at the head of their troops, Don Alonzo
meeting them with the keys of the city, and saying:
‘The gates are now open, and the desires of the
people are turned to serve the King and your
Lordship. They seek for pardon.’</p>

<p>The Viceroy did not answer. He entered the
city and executed what he called justice. Crispin
was cut into four quarters, as were all his thirteen
councillors. The number of persons who were
hanged and quartered was 420.</p>

<p>Such is the account of the surrender of Palma
given by an eyewitness and actor in the sanguinary
drama.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> One side seems to have been every bit as
bloodthirsty as the other. Time alone could heal
the wounds. Don Alonzo was sent to Ivi&ccedil;a with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
his five hundred men, where he did good service
against Barbarossa and his pirates.</p>

<p>From the first rising to the restoration of order,
the troubles had lasted for more than two years.</p>

<p>Don Miguel de Gurrea or Urrea, the Viceroy,
who had shown so much prudence at the commencement
when he was powerless, and so much courage
as soon as he had troops at his disposal, sent the
keys of the kingdom to the Emperor. Keys
finely worked in gold were sent in their place,
which the descendants of Gurrea preserve to this
day. Alcudia received the title of ‘the most
faithful city.’</p>

<p>The principal nobles who valorously resisted
the rebellion and restored order were Priamo de
Villalonga, Alfonso Torrella, Salvador Sureda,
Jayme Oleza, Matias Fortu&ntilde;y, Mateo Togores,
Albertin Damato, Antonio Gual, Zaforteza,
Despuig, Cotoner&mdash;all names which appear in the
annals of their country, from generation to generation,
down to this day.</p>

<p>The insurrection caused great misery and
destruction of property, and it was quite a century
before the islanders can be said to have recovered
from its evil effects, either morally or as regards

<span class="medium table">The Majorcan historians&mdash;War of succession&mdash;Families ennobled&mdash;Cotoners&mdash;Raxa
and Cardinal Despuig&mdash;Country houses</span></h2>

<p>With the war of the ‘Comunidades’ the romance
of Majorcan history ends. During the seventeenth
century the country was very slowly recovering
from the effects of that disastrous rising; but it
was long before the good relations between the
different classes of the people were restored. The
island was governed under the Kings of the House
of Austria by Viceroys, of whom five were natives
of Majorca. The names of Moncada, Fuster, Pax,
Zaforteza, and Sureda occur in the list.</p>

<p>But though the making of history seemed to
be dead, the work of recording the glorious annals
of Majorca under her own kings was zealously
undertaken by natives of the island. The first
official chronicler, appointed by the Jurados, was
Don Juan Dameto. He wrote the ‘Historia
General del reino Balearico’ between 1621 and
1631, and died prematurely in 1633. His work
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
commences with the earliest Roman times and is
brought down to the death of Jayme II. Dameto
had travelled much and was an accomplished
scholar. His work is by no means a mere chronicle.
The style is agreeable and full without being
prolix, and shows a sense of proportion and of the
relative importance of events.</p>

<p>Don Vicente Mut, who was born at Palma in
1614, was the continuator of Dameto. He was a
military man and major of the militia of his
island, an accomplished mathematician, as well
as a student of history. He searched the archives
with great diligence, and gives valuable details
respecting the administration of the island at
different periods. His history covers the ground
from the accession of King Sancho to the suppression
of the ‘Comunidades,’ and contains
spirited accounts of the raids of Barbary pirates
and histories of the monasteries and hospitals.
Mut died in 1687.</p>

<p>With him our accessible island histories end,
for the history of Geronimo Alemany, which would
bring the record down to the death of Charles II.,
the last King of the House of Austria, is still in
manuscript. We have to thank Don Miguel
Moragues Pro and Don Joaquim Maria Bover for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
having edited the histories of Dameto and Mut,
with very copious notes. The three thick volumes
were published at Palma in 1841, and a fourth
volume containing the history by Alemany was
promised. Visitors to Palma who take an intelligent
interest in the history of the island will
desire to possess and to read them. They will
find the three volumes at the excellent book-seller’s
shop of Don Felipe Guasp, No. 6 Morey
Street, the first turn to the right after crossing
the Plaza de Santa Eulalia.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century opened with the war of
succession. The French claimant was a grandson
of a sister of Charles II. The German claimant
was a grandson of Charles’s aunt. Catalonia and
Majorca espoused the cause of the German archduke,
while the rest of Spain proclaimed the French
prince as Philip V. On October 1, 1706, Majorca
was occupied by the troops of the Archduke
Charles, and all adherents of the French claimant
were persecuted or banished. Even after the fall
of Barcelona the Majorcans held out. But all
was in vain. In June 1715 a large army landed
and besieged Palma, which capitulated after a
siege of seventeen days, and the Bourbons forced
the islanders to submit to their yoke. All the
ancient privileges and grants of the Aragonese
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
monarchs to the Majorcans were abolished, with
their form of government. Captains-general were
substituted for the Viceroys, and the present fortifications
of Palma were constructed in the reign of
Philip V. Majorca suffered from the misgovernment
of Bourbon rule with the rest of Spain.
From that time the people have had to rely upon
their own virility, energy, and skill for any advance
in civilisation and well-being, and not in vain.
The Majorcans steadily progressed, while their
old families, claiming descent from the soldiers of
King Jayme, became distinguished in arms and
letters and were ennobled, several as early as the
times of the Austrian kings. In 1625 the title of
Marquis of Bellpuig was given to the family of
Dameto y Cotoner, in 1632 that of Santa Maria
de Formiguera to the family of Burgues Zaforteza
y Villalonga, in 1634 that of Count of Ayamans
to the family of Togores (formerly Moncada), in
1658 that of Count of Montenegro to the family of
Despuig, and in 1717 that of Count of Aria&ntilde;y to
the family of Cotoner. Several titles were also
conferred on Majorcan families during the
eighteenth century; generally well deserved.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>Among the distinguished sons of the Cotoner
family was Rafael Cotoner, who was Grand Master
of Malta from 1660 to 1663. He built Fort
Ricasoli and the lines which are still known as the
Cotonera. His brother, Nicolas Cotoner, was
Grand Master from 1663 to 1680. An almost
equally distinguished member of this family was
the late General Cotoner, who was Governor of
Porto Rico, and was devotedly attached to his
native island and her interests.</p>

<p>But it was to members of the ancient family
of Despuig that Majorca owed its fame as a place
of cultured learning during the eighteenth century.
Descended from Bernardo Despuig, a companion
of the Conqueror Jayme I., the family has always
been closely connected with the history of the
island. Among them Juan Bautista Despuig
served at Lepanto and in Flanders; but his best
title to fame was that he devoted his wealth to
the promotion of the well-being of his poorer
neighbours and won the title of ‘Father of the
Poor.’ His grandson did such good service as a
military commander that in 1658 he was created
Count of Montenegro. The first Count’s son,
Bernardo, was Grand Master of the Order of
St. John of Jerusalem at Malta from 1736 to 1741.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Juan Despuig, the second Count of Montenegro
and also Count of Montoro by right of his mother,
espoused the Bourbon side in the War of Succession,
and suffered a long imprisonment in the castle of
Belver from 1706 to 1715, the period of the
Austrian occupation of the island. Many other
members of the family were distinguished for their
services to the State. The best-known is Dr. Don
Antonio Despuig, who was Archbishop of Valencia
and of Seville and Cardinal of San Calisto, a
prelate not more famed for his learning than for
the love he always showed for his island home.</p>

<p>Cardinal Despuig has left many memorials
which will ever secure for him an honourable
place in the island’s history. He devoted both
time, money, and a cultivated taste to enriching
the country seat of his nephew, the Count of
Montenegro, as well as his palace in Palma, with
the most precious literary and artistic productions
of Italy and Spain.</p>

<p>The country seat of Raxa is a place of enchantment
at the foot of the mountains, approached
from Palma through miles of almond-groves in
full blossom during February. In Moorish times
it was called Araxa, and was granted by King
Jayme I. to the Count of Ampurias, becoming the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
property of the family of Despuig in 1620. Raxa
is a large house of three storeys, built round a
courtyard, with an ancient elm-tree in the centre.
The rooms are exceedingly numerous, and all the
furniture is of a date at least 150 years ago. There
are many beautiful Florentine cabinets, some good
pictures, and fayence. The dining-room has a
carved oak ceiling in squares, with an old fayence
plate let into each. One room is full of valuable
Vatican engravings, another of paintings of Rome
as it was 150 years ago. One side of the house
has balconies, with arcades, looking on the garden
and over a lovely view. The great glory of Raxa
is the museum of Roman sculpture. Cardinal
Despuig acquired a site near Albano, where once
had stood the superb temple to Egeria, built by
the Emperor Domitian. Between 1787 and 1796
the Cardinal conducted excavations which brought
to light many statues, busts, altars, and other
remains, which he sent to Majorca to adorn his
nephew’s country seat. There is a very fine
statue of Trajan, others of Caligula, Hercules, a
gladiator, &amp;c. A full descriptive list is given in
Bover’s ‘Noticias Historico-topograficas.’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> Opposite
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
to the door of the museum is that of the
chapel, where there is a picture of Jesus and the
Woman of Samaria.</p>

<p>There is a charming garden, with fountains,
in front of the house, and orange-groves beyond.
Behind there are garden terraces up the mountain
side, and two very large tanks. A long flight of
steps, with statues on either side and water flowing
down in masonry channels, leads up to loftier
terraces with flower-beds and groves of cypress,
pine-trees, and laurustinus. It is like fairyland;
and from a summer-house there are views of the
sea of almond-blossoms extending to Palma on
one side, and of the pine-clad mountains and
serrated peaks on the other.</p>

<p>Many of the treasures collected by the Cardinal
are in the Montenegro palace in the city of Palma.
This palace, in the street of the same name, has
a courtyard with palm-trees, whence a wide stone
staircase leads to a gallery, where is the front
door. The rooms are large and lofty, richly
furnished, and warmed by <i>braseros</i>. At the back
of the house there is a good-sized garden with
palm-trees and an evergreen oak. In this palace
are more of the treasures collected by the Cardinal.
The famous <i>portolano</i> of Valseca has already been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
fully described. At the top of the house is the
magnificent library, arranged in subjects. One
of the most valuable books is a manuscript
‘Nobiliario’ of the Aragonese nobility of the
fifteenth century, with coats of arms beautifully
painted. Here, too, is the original manuscript of
Alemany’s history. The poetical and historical
works are the most numerous, including fine editions
of ‘Don Quijote.’ The room is of great length,
and at the end was the cabinet of coins, Roman
Consular and Imperial, Spanish-Arabian, Gothic,
and Aragonese kings. According to Bover, the
finest collection of Majorcan coins is in the cabinet
of the Count of Ayamans.</p>

<p>Cardinal Despuig, who was an intimate friend
of Pope Pius VI., died at Lucca on May 2, 1813,
leaving to his country a thousand memorials
which will give his name an honoured place in the
Balearic <i>fasti</i>. His nephew, for whom all these
collections were made, died in the same year.
This Count’s son, Ramon, fifth Count of Montenegro,
was Captain-General of Majorca, and
died in 1848. The present Count, to whose
great courtesy our knowledge of Raxa and the
Cardinal’s treasures is due, is a grandson of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
Captain-General, and is the seventh Count of
Montenegro.</p>

<p>Majorca boasts other country houses almost
as beautiful, though not quite so interesting as
Raxa. Alfavia has already been described, and
Canet, the home of the Torrellas, has been mentioned.
Another charming country seat is La
Granja de Esporla, the home of the Fortu&ntilde;y
family. It is in a valley, with mountain-spurs on
either side and abundant supplies of water. The
house is built round a courtyard, one side having
a wide stone passage on the upper storey, with
open colonnades. Over the archway into the
courtyard there is a stone coat of arms of Fortu&ntilde;y
(<i>argent five pellets</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>two</i>, <i>and one</i>; quartering
Gual, Despuig, and Zaforteza). There is a very
large stone-paved hall, hung with pictures, which
opens on to a narrow garden leading to terraces
up the mountain-side, fountains, and artificial
grottos. In front there is a long pergola of roses,
orange and lemon groves, and a splendid old yew-tree.
The mountains are clothed with ilex as
well as pine-trees.</p>

<p>There are great advantages in the chief people
of the island living in their country houses during
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the summer and having personal intercourse with
their people. It encourages enterprise. Thus at
Esporlas there are extensive cloth-factories, and
at Canet, under the patronage of the Torrellas,
there is a fayence-manufactory, producing vases
with very beautiful designs.

<span class="medium table">The Marquis of Romana and the patriot Jovellanos.</span></h2>

<p>The romance of Majorcan history seemed to have
come to an end with young Jayme IV. and his
sister; but it was renewed in the career of the
Marquis of Romana, the most distinguished of
later Majorcans.</p>

<p>Like many other noble families of the Peninsula,
the Caros derive their coat-armour from an
incident in the memorable battle of Las Navas de
Tolosa.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Juan Caro accompanied En Jayme in
the conquest of Majorca. His descendants were
in the conquest of Almeria, the wars of Flanders,
the battle of Los Gelves, the sea-fight of Lepanto,
and many other combats against the enemies of
Spain. They held estates in Orihuela, Elche,
Crevillente, and Novelda, and the feudal castle
of Maza, as well as extensive property in Majorca.
Don Jos&eacute; Caro was created Marquis of La Romana
and Viscount of Benaesa in 1739 for his great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
services during the War of Succession. Don Pedro
Caro, the third Marquis, was born at Palma in
1761, and lost his father, a very distinguished
naval officer, when he was only fourteen. The
third Marquis entered the navy, rising to the rank
of captain of a frigate, but exchanged into the
army in order to serve under his uncle, General
Ventura Caro, in the first war with revolutionary
France. He had risen to the rank of lieutenant-general
when Mr. Hookham Frere came to Madrid
as Ambassador from England in 1803. They at
once became great friends, the Marquis being of
immense use to the English diplomatist in explaining
to him the state of parties at the Spanish Court.
Southey says of Romana that he was ‘a man
whose happy nature had resisted all the evil and
debilitating influences of the age and rank in which
he was born. He possessed a rare union of frankness
and prudence, while he read with unerring
intuition the characters of others. Spain has never
produced a man more excellently brave, more
dutifully devoted to his country, more free from
the taint of selfishness, more truly noble.’</p>

<p>When Napoleon got possession of the resources
of Spain and was able to issue his decrees through
the corrupt government of Godoy, he sought to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
weaken those resources in order that Spain might
fall an easier prey when the time was ripe. With
this object the Marquis of Romana was ordered
to march with fourteen thousand men, being the
best troops in the Spanish army, to the other end
of Europe. This was in August 1807, when
Romana’s force was quartered at Hamburg and
Lubeck. The Spanish contingent was intended
to form part of a Franco-Danish army under
Bernadotte for the invasion of Sweden. The
Spanish regiments were then placed in garrisons
at Aarhuus, Ebeltoft, Mariager, Aalborg, and
Randers in Jutland, in the island of Funen, and
two regiments in Zeeland. They were closely
watched and cut off from all intercourse with
Spain. But an English squadron under Saumarez
effectually prevented an invasion of Sweden.</p>

<p>When the whole of Spain rose against the
usurping government of Joseph Bonaparte it
became a matter of the utmost importance to
communicate the news to Romana and his troops,
and to restore them to their country. But it was
a service of extreme difficulty. The French cut
off all communication and vigilantly intercepted
letters; while the Spaniards in Denmark were
informed that all their countrymen were unanimous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
in their allegiance to Joseph. A priest named
Robertson, an accomplished linguist, was selected
by Mr. Frere to convey the news to Romana. To
give him written credentials was too dangerous;
but Mr. Frere hit upon a way of convincing
Romana that the message was genuine. Robertson
was to quote to him a line from the poem of
the ‘Cid,’ with an emendation. When Romana
and Frere were at Madrid together, the former
advised his English friend to read that poem.
One day Romana called upon his friend, when
Frere had just made a suggested emendation in
the line:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Aun vea el hora que vos <i>merezca dos</i> tanto.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Frere suggested <i>merezcades</i>, and Romana concurred
in its propriety. No one but Romana and Frere
knew of this; so that, on quoting it, the Marquis
was convinced that Robertson came from Frere.
Romana then first heard the real situation of his
country. They conversed in Latin. The Spanish
general at once resolved to effect his escape from
Denmark with his troops, if he could obtain the
help of the British naval commanders. So
Robertson found his way to H.M.S. <i>Victory</i>, the
flagship of Admiral Saumarez in the Baltic, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
told his story. The Admiral at once saw that
the matter was urgent, and sent a squadron under
Keats, his second in command, to communicate
with Romana.</p>

<p>It was necessary to maintain the utmost
secrecy while arranging for all the Spanish garrisons
to concentrate for embarkation, in defiance of
French and Danes. Romana and Keats worked
in concert, but the operation was extremely
difficult. The various garrisons in Jutland were
to seize vessels in the different harbours, and come
to the island of Funen, where Romana had occupied
the town of Nyborg on the Great Belt. Here
Admiral Keats waited with his ships.</p>

<p>All went well. The Jutland garrisons arrived
and were embarked, in spite of some opposition
from two Danish gunboats. The Spanish troops
were taken to Gottenburg, where transports had
been provided to convey them to their native
country. They were landed at Santander.</p>

<p>The Marquis de la Romana himself went to
London to confer with the British Government.
He accompanied Mr. Hookham Frere to Spain,
who had been accredited as Envoy to the Central
Junta. Both arrived at Coru&ntilde;a on October 20,
1808, and Romana proceeded to take command of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the Spanish forces in Galicia. Here the indefatigable
Majorcan maintained an unequal contest
with Soult and Ney. Routed in February 1809
at Monterey, he still kept the field, aroused the
whole country by his proclamations and by the
sight of his patriotic zeal, and in the following
April captured the French garrison at Villa Franca.</p>

<p>Finding that Ney was collecting a great force
to annihilate him, Romana crossed the mountains
at the passes of Cienfuegos and marched into the
Asturias. Leaving his army at Navia de Suara,
the general went on to Oviedo to organise the
civil government of the province. Ney then conceived
a plan of surprising the troops at Navia
de Suara and securing the person of Romana.
He sent Kellermann by forced marches to Oviedo,
but the Marquis was not to be caught. He
galloped down to the port of Gijon with his staff
and returned by sea to Galicia. His troops also
retreated safely across the mountains.</p>

<p>In 1809 Romana was appointed to be a member
of the Central Junta at Seville, and he bade farewell
to his faithful troops, who had escaped with
him from Denmark and shared all his desperate
campaigning work in Galicia. As a member of
the Central Junta the Marquis drew up a very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
able State paper for the better government of the
country, which had the concurrence both of
Mr. Frere and of his successor, Lord Wellesley.
In January 1810 he was appointed to command
the Spanish army in Estremadura, where he did
excellent service and saved Badajos at least for
the time. When Lord Wellington retreated behind
the lines of Torres Vedras, Romana joined him
with four thousand men, and they then first
became acquainted.</p>

<p>Wellington concerted his plans with Romana,
who was, in the ensuing campaign, to keep open
communications with Badajos, behind the Gevora.
The Marquis began his march thither, but died
very suddenly of heart-disease on January 23,
1811. A small edition of Pindar was found in
his pocket. His death was most disastrous, for
the troops had no confidence in his successor, and
Badajos was lost.</p>

<p>Wellington appreciated the great qualities of
this illustrious Majorcan soldier. He recorded his
sense of Romana’s services in the following tribute
to his memory: ‘In Romana the Spanish army
has lost its brightest ornament, his country their
most upright patriot, and the world the most
strenuous and zealous defender of the cause in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
which we are engaged. I shall always acknowledge
with gratitude the assistance which I received
from him, as well by his operations as by his
counsel, since he had been joined with this army.’<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
The body of the great Majorcan was conveyed to
his native island. The funeral took place with all
possible solemnity on June 4, 1811, and a monument
was voted by the Cortes.</p>

<p>The monument is on the east wall of one of
the northern side-chapels in the cathedral. The
recumbent figure of the Marquis of Romana rests
on a tomb, all in white marble, and beside it is
another figure, pointing upwards, supposed to be
the Duke of Wellington. Below there is a bas-relief
with Romana and Admiral Keats superintending
the embarkation of Spanish troops and
baggage at Nyborg, in the island of Funen.</p>

<p>The son of the great general, also named
Pedro, succeeded as fourth Marquis of Romana,
and married Do&ntilde;a Tomas Alvarez de Toledo y
Palafox, Duchess of Montalto. He died in 1848,
and was succeeded by Don Pedro Caro, the fifth
Marquis, who married a Hungarian lady of rank,
Isabel Szechenyi Zichy-Ferraris. She built the
castle of Bendinat, as has already been mentioned;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
but afterwards disposed of all the Caro property
in Majorca, and went to Madrid, where her son,
the present and sixth Marquis of La Romana,
now resides.</p>

<p>Every visitor to Palma should go to the tomb
of the illustrious Majorcan, whose splendid career
was so closely connected with most interesting
episodes in English history. Romana was the
intimate friend of Hookham Frere, one of the most
distinguished among the diplomatists and men of
letters of the last century; and he won the esteem
and friendship of the great Duke of Wellington.</p>

<p>At the same time that the corrupt government
of Godoy sent the Marquis of Romana and fourteen
thousand patriotic soldiers to Denmark, an equally
illustrious man was sent a prisoner to Majorca.
Jovellanos is connected with the island, not as a
native, but as one whose iniquitous imprisonment
won for him the warm sympathy of the
islanders.</p>

<p>Gaspar Melchior de Jovellanos was born at
Gijon, the chief seaport of the Asturias, in 1744,
and received a liberal education. After a close
study of civil and canon law, he became a judge
at Seville, and afterwards at Madrid. He was a
student of political economy and history, while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
he also attained eminence as a poet. His prose
writings proved him to be a philosophical statesman
as well as a very able man of letters. His
liberal views were not acceptable to the favourite
of Charles IV., and Jovellanos was sent into exile
in his native province of Asturias. In 1797 he
was recalled and became Minister of Justice.
But Godoy still hated his enlightened opinions,
and in the following year he was again banished
to the Asturias.</p>

<p>The wretched favourite of Charles IV. was not
yet satisfied. In 1801, in violation of law and
decency, the illustrious statesman was seized in
his bed, hurried across Spain like a common
criminal, and sent a prisoner to Majorca. At
first he was confined in the Cartuja at Valdemosa,
but after a year he was removed to a prison in
the castle of Belver. He was treated with such
rigour that almost all communication with the
outer world was cut off.</p>

<p>Latterly he was allowed to receive papers,
and was even enabled to make researches in the
archives. We are indebted to Jovellanos for an
excellent account of the building of the cathedral
and for learned pamphlets on the ‘Lonja’ and on
the castle of Belver.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span></p>

<p>At last came the fall of the favourite and the
abdication of Charles IV. This at once led to the
liberation of Jovellanos, who was welcomed back
and received the admiration of his countrymen for
his great services and for the calm patience with
which he had endured his unjust sufferings. He
represented Asturias in the Central Junta at
Seville, and on its dissolution he returned to his
home in the hope that he would be allowed to end
his days in peace. He was at Gijon, his native
town, when the French made the sudden incursion
into the Asturias in the hope of capturing the
Marquis of Romana. He sought safety on board
a small vessel, which landed him at the little port
of Vega. There he died on November 27, 1811,
at the age of fifty-seven. Ticknor, who was well
acquainted with the writings of Jovellanos, wrote
of him that ‘he left behind him few men, in any
country, of a greater elevation of mind, and fewer
still of a purer or more irreproachable character.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>The old castle of Belver continued to be misused
during the dark times of recent Spanish
history for the imprisonment of Carlist and other
political victims. But the interesting building is
now declared to be ‘patrimonio real,’ is inhabited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
by courteous and intelligent guardians, and is
pen to the public.</p>

<p>In the gloomy vaulted room where Jovellanos
was imprisoned for six years his island admirers
have put up a marble tablet recording the fact
and commemorative of his patriotic virtues.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span></p>

<span class="medium table">Conclusion</span></h2>

<p>The story of Majorca has, in the course of its
detailed narration, included attempts to describe
the scenery of various localities of the island, the
capital in ancient times, the mountains and caves,
the towns and country houses. With the conclusion
of the story we turn to the island as it
is at present. We find areas of forest-covered
mountains, which are calculated to contain 25,000
acres of pines, 12,000 acres of ilex, and 2,000 of
carob-trees; at least, this was the calculation
twenty years ago. The best account of the geology
of these mountains will be found in the work of
M. Hermite.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Turning to the trees grown to support the
people in the fertile plains, the same authority
gives an area of 50,000 acres as covered by vines
and 33,000 by almond-trees, besides apricots.
The olives cover 86,000 acres&mdash;70,000 in the
mountains, and the rest for the most part near
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
their bases. The flora of the island is abundant
and beautiful; and there is an excellent book on
the subject by Don Francisco Barcelo y Combis.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>The people are the descendants of men who
fought with En Jayme, increased by a certain
amount of immigration&mdash;Catalans who speak a
dialect of the Catalan language among themselves,
but who nearly all understand Spanish. Among
the upper classes the names of Moncada or Togores,
Sureda, Cotoner, Fortu&ntilde;y, Zaforteza, Despuig,
Torrellas, Truyolls, Villalonga, are as prominent
now as they were six hundred years ago and have
been ever since. After a visitor has seen the
cathedral and churches, the Lonja with its slender
pillars, and the handsome Casa Consistorial with
its frescoes and portraits of Majorcan worthies,
nothing can be more interesting than to saunter
through the streets and look at the old palaces of
the nobility, with their quaint architecture, coats
of arms, and picturesque courtyards. In front of
the ‘Mercado’ is the great palace of the Burgues
Zaforteza family. In a street of the same name
is the Montenegro palace. In the narrow Fortu&ntilde;y
Street there is an ancient house with the name of
Priamo Villalonga carved over the lintel of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
door. Here lived the gallant defender of the
royal castle against the rebels in 1522. The
Villalongas are no longer there, having moved to
a more modern abode in another part of the
town. In nearly every street there is a palace or
some other building which is interesting either
for its architecture or its associations.</p>

<p>Among the leading people of Palma the name
of Don Bartolom&eacute; Bosch y Cerda, His Britannic
Majesty’s Vice-Consul, cannot be overlooked, for
his courtesy and kindness and his thorough knowledge
of the island have largely increased the
pleasure derived by many visitors from a sojourn
in Majorca.</p>

<p>The best-known visitor&mdash;if His Highness ought
not rather to be called a resident&mdash;was the Archduke
Luis Salvator, whose magnificent monograph
of the Balearic Islands is well known. Miramar
has been mentioned as the abode of King Sancho,
and afterwards as the place where Raimondo Lulio
founded his college. But it is better known as the
spot which the Archduke turned into an earthly
paradise. He rebuilt the house which existed on
the site of the former convent, laid out the lovely
garden, and constructed roads and paths. He
filled the house with old Majorcan furniture and
Majolica ware, some of it with the metallic lustre
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
for the manufacture of which the island was once
famous. The Archduke also restored a little
chapel in the garden, which contains an ancient
picture of Raimondo Lulio. But it is now more
than twelve years since the Archduke has visited
the island.</p>

<p>The Majorcans excel as masons and carpenters.
The mole, which forms the harbour, is as fine a
piece of masonry work as is to be found in the
Mediterranean. All the ashlar work of public
buildings is remarkable for the fineness and
exactness of the points of junction; and the
vaulting, especially in the churches, displays no
small mechanical skill, and even genius. Carpenters’
work is equally good; and it is interesting to see
them at work, with their shops open to the streets.
There are many factories in the island; and while
one member of a family works on a farm, others
at trades, the rest can get employment in factories.
All help, and the cottage in which the family lives
generally has a small garden of flowers and vegetables.
All the people are decently dressed and
shod and have sufficient food. The Majorcans are
certainly a handsome race, the men strongly built
and well set up, the young women comely and
graceful.</p>

<p>There are no beggars, except a few cripples.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Begging or seeking presents is not the habit of
the people. If boys are offered small change
received in a shop they will generally refuse it,
saying that they have done nothing for it. The
cathedral carpenter sent his boy up a tree, at the
request of a stranger, to get a leaf, and he was
given a shilling for want of change. Some time
afterwards the same stranger was passing, and
the carpenter came out with the difference between
a shilling and a <i>peseta</i>, saying he thought that
the present was intended to be a <i>peseta</i> and not a
shilling. Information respecting land tenures,
mode of cultivation, exports, and other statistics
will be found in Mr. Bidwell’s ‘Balearic Islands.’<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<p>The story of Majorca is necessarily very closely
connected with the general history of Aragon and
its various dependencies. It is full of chivalrous
deeds and wonderful adventures, as well as of
evidence of those more solid and steady efforts
which indicate fine qualities in a race. Thus, in
the course of centuries, the existing islanders have
been formed, and they are very much what might
have been expected from their history. It is a
history which should have a place in the study of
European progress and development; for, small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
though the island is, the Majorcans have been in
the forefront during the Middle Ages, and even in
later times, alike as men of the sword and men of
the pen. A knowledge of the island’s story will
furnish a number of historical associations which
will, as it were, clothe the beautiful scenery with
living interest. It thus appeals alike to the
student who remains at home and to the traveller
who visits the island.</p>

<p>It seems desirable to conclude with some
information for the latter class of readers respecting
accommodation at Palma. The hotel, which was
opened a few years ago by Se&ntilde;or Albareda, faces
the old church of St. Nicholas and the Zaforteza
palace; while the avenue called the ‘Rambla’ is
on one hand, and the ‘Paseo del Borne,’ leading
to the port, on the other. It possesses every
comfort and convenience, is admirably managed,
and has a well-informed and most obliging landlord.
This ‘Grand Hotel’ has a pleasant annex
in the country, at Porto Pi, and the hotel in the
beautiful valley of Soller is also comfortable and
well managed. The visitor to Majorca is thus
able to make himself acquainted with the lovely
scenery, the history, and present condition of the
island under the most advantageous conditions.

<span class="medium table">Minorca&mdash;Its prehistoric remains&mdash;Mago the Carthaginian&mdash;Successive
occupations</span></h2>

<p>The sister island of Minorca is some twenty miles
E.N.E. of Majorca, and is about the size of the
Isle of Wight, twenty-one miles in length by
eight broad. But its smaller size and more
exposed situation deprive it of advantages enjoyed
by its more favoured sister. Minorca is in the
shape of an irregular parallelogram, lying W.N.W.
to E.S.E., and has an area of 683 square kilometres.
The island is divided into two distinct
regions of almost equal extent by a line running
east and west. The northern half is covered
with hills, for the most part bare, with two culminating
points. Near the centre of the island is
‘Monte Toro,’ rising in the form of a sugarloaf
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
to a height of 1,150 feet. Farther west is the
Monte de Santa Agueda, 850 feet high. The rock
consists of slates, with strata generally much
contorted and of Devonian age, but capped in
some places by Jurassic rocks which contain fossils
and numerous impressions of plants.</p>

<p>Owing to the frequent northerly gales, especially
in the winter, the arboreal vegetation of the
northern region, and indeed of the whole island,
is scanty. There are some woods of ilex and
Aleppo pines in sheltered places, and the shrub
vegetation consists of myrtle, a <i>Phillirea</i> (wild
olive?), and three species of <i>Erica</i>.</p>

<p>The southern region is more sheltered and more
fertile. It consists of an undulating tableland
cut by profound ravines and sloping from the
hills to the southern coast, where it terminates
in rocky cliffs. The formation is a good building
limestone of Miocene age with nearly horizontal
strata. In this southern region the shrubby
vegetation consists of a buckthorn (<i>Rhamnus
Alaternus</i>) and the <i>lentisco</i> (<i>Pistacia Lentiscus</i>).
But there are few trees, and the ground is
excessively stony. In the ravines the vegetation
becomes richer and more varied.</p>

<p>There are no rivers or streams, and the people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
are entirely dependent on wells and cisterns for
their supply of water. The rocks abound in
caves, some natural, but many excavated in prehistoric
times. There is one vast stalactitic cave
near the western coast, with smaller branch
caverns, and several other caves of the same kind
on a smaller scale.</p>

<p>One of the principal features of interest in
Minorca is the number of prehistoric remains
scattered over the southern region. There are a
few similar remains in Majorca, but they have
been used almost entirely for building materials;
and in Minorca they are far more numerous and
less injured.</p>

<p>The primitive inhabitants appear to have been
cave-dwellers. The buildings may have belonged
to a later period. They have been described by
several observers, notably by M. Emile Cartailhac
in his ‘Monuments primitifs des Iles Bal&eacute;ares’;<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>
but never more clearly, and with more competent
knowledge of similar monuments in other parts of
the world, than by Dr. Guillemard in his very
able paper read before the Cambridge Antiquarian
Society. Dr. Guillemard divides the Minorcan
prehistoric buildings into four classes: (1) the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
so-called towns, (2) the <i>Naus</i> or ship-like edifices,
(3) the <i>Taulas</i> or <i>Bilithons</i>, (4) the <i>Talayuts</i>.</p>

<p>The towns, really the size of small hamlets,
are surrounded by a wall with a megalithic gateway,
and sometimes with small towers on the
walls, which consist of large blocks of limestone.
Inside there are the remains of small square
buildings, with underground low and narrow passages
or caves.</p>

<p>The <i>Naus</i> is a building with a supposed resemblance
to a ship, one end being pointed and the
other square. There are only a few on the island.
Cartailhac mentions nine. Their length is from
twenty-five to forty feet, height fifteen to eighteen.
The finest, called ‘Nau d’Es Tudons,’ is near
Ciudadela. It consists of large blocks of stone
dressed with a hammer. The entrance is three
feet square, leading to a sort of vestibule, whence
another door opens into the main chamber, which
is supported by pillars down the middle. These
edifices are carefully built, and were evidently the
tombs of great men.</p>

<p>The <i>Taulas</i> are two massive stones joined by
a deep tenon and mortise and cut with remarkable
care. The lower one is upright, and bears the
upper one horizontally, like a table. They are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
in the centre of a building in the form of a semicircle
forty feet across, the two ends being joined
by a wall. Some twelve or fourteen <i>taulas</i> remain.
They must almost certainly have been altars, or
the main features of temples. These <i>taulas</i> appear
to be closely allied to such edifices as Stonehenge
or those at Avebury. In that case, they may be
considered to date from about the same period, a
date which has been ascertained astronomically by
Sir Norman Lockyer&mdash;2000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The race of men
who built them extended over Europe. They had
dolichocephalic heads of average capacity, oval
faces, aquiline noses, low foreheads, exactly like
the skulls from the Basque provinces. They were
not only spread over Europe, but established
themselves in Mauritania (Morocco) and were
probably the ancestors alike of the Guanches of
Tenerife and the Baleares of these islands.</p>

<p>The fourth class of prehistoric edifices consists
of the <i>Talayuts</i>, so called from the Arabic
‘Atalaya’ or scout, hence watch-tower. Their
height is usually not more than twenty feet. The
largest, called ‘Torre Llafuda,’ is forty feet high.
They are often forty feet in diameter at the base
and six or seven feet less at the top. In 1818
Ramis gave a list of 195 of them, of which 142
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
were in fair condition. Since that time many
have been used for limekilns or as quarries in
building houses. They are all built of the rough
vesicular limestone of the surrounding land, and
the stones are generally roughly dressed and laid
in courses. The walls are of enormous thickness,
with a circular chamber in the centre, supported
by a pillar of massive stones. There is usually a
doorway on the south side.</p>

<p>Their object has been a puzzle. They were not
watch-towers from the positions of many of them;
not fortresses, not dwellings, not temples, not
tombs, for no bones are found. I believe that
Dr. Guillemard, whose excellent descriptions of
the Minorcan prehistoric remains I have been
quoting, has hit upon the right solution. The
fields are covered with stones, and one of the
principal occupations of the husbandman is to
clear the stones off the cultivable land. In
modern times they make stone walls, for something
has to be done with them. Dr. Guillemard
holds that the <i>talayuts</i> are the stones cleared from
the fields by the ancient people. They built these
very solid towers with them, which served to
house pigs and sheep at night; perhaps also as a
look-out place, where their positions would serve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
such a purpose. But clearing the fields of stones
was the primary object.</p>

<p>The Minorcan builders of stone temples, tombs,
and dwellings, and pilers up of stones were prehistoric
beyond any doubt, and may have worked
and worshipped them four thousand years ago.
The Phœnicians probably found their descendants
on the island, and they became subject to the
Semitic traders and their Carthaginian offshoots,
who held the Balearic Islands while they were
dominant in Spain. Minorca was best known as
possessing the most capacious and safest harbour
in the Mediterranean, and its name of Port Mahon
makes the giver of that name an important factor
in the story of the island.</p>

<p>Mago was the youngest son of Hamilcar
Barca, and when he first began to serve under
his brother Hannibal in Italy, in <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 218, he must
have been very young; but his capacity and
fitness for command were soon realised by the
great general. Mago was given command of the
cavalry, and led his troops across the river Po,
each man swimming by the side of his horse.
Mago did distinguished service at the battle of
Trebia, and was by his brother’s side at Cann&aelig;.
He was then detached to reduce Samnium and the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Bruttii. In about <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 212 he was sent to reinforce
his other brother, Hasdrubal, in Spain. It was a
losing cause, for the Carthaginians vainly opposed
the victorious career of Scipio. The brothers resisted
long. At last they were hopelessly defeated by Scipio
at a place called Silpia, apparently in the Sierra
Morena. Mago long held out at Gades. Here he
received orders to collect troops and ships, and to
make a diversion by landing at Genoa and transferring
the seat of war to Italy. Having diligently
assembled troops and the means of transport, he
left Spain for ever and made sail, shaping a course,
in compliance with his instructions, from Carthage.
Mago wintered in the splendid harbour at the
eastern end of Minorca, which has ever since borne
his name&mdash;Portus Magonis, corrupted into Port
Mahon.</p>

<p>Eventually he landed his army at Genoa, but
was defeated by Quinctilius Varro in a battle in
Liguria, when he was severely wounded. Hannibal
and Mago were recalled from Italy <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 203, and
the younger brother died of his wounds on the
voyage to Carthage, according to Livy. He was
probably not more than thirty-two years of age.
The name of this enterprising Carthaginian is
immortalised in that of the harbour where he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
wintered, and in those of an English earl’s second
title and of a Spanish dukedom.</p>

<p>During their occupation the Carthaginians had
built three towns: the Portus Magonis; the
town at the west end of the island, called Jamno,
the modern Ciudadela; and one in the interior.
In <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> 121 Metellus arrived with his fleet, and
the Balearic Islands passed under the dominion
of Rome. For more than five hundred years the
islands formed part of the Roman Empire, Minorca
always sharing the fate of her larger and more
important sister. These huge gaps in history
leave everything to conjecture. They may have
been a time of peace and prosperity, or they may
have been a period of grinding oppression. The
people were probably still the descendants of the
prehistoric builders. Certainly no great event
happened, or it would have been recorded. On
the decay of Roman power, in the days of
Honorius, the Balearic Islands are said to have
been occupied for a time by the Vandals, from
<span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 426. It is assumed that the islands formed
part of the kingdom of the Spanish Visigoths;
but all that may have happened in that long
period is buried in oblivion. We only know that
Christianity had been introduced, and that at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
the Council of Toledo, celebrated in the year
675 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, there were bishops of the Balearic Isles,
dating for at least two hundred years back, for
Severo was Bishop of Minorca in 423.</p>

<p>Before the commencement of the ninth century
the islands had fallen entirely into the hands of
the Moors, and formed part of the empire of the
Omeyad Kh&acirc;lifas of Cordova, Minorca continuing
through all the long period of Moorish domination
to share the fate of the larger island. The aboriginal
inhabitants must have entirely disappeared,
giving place to immigrants from Africa and
Muhammadan Spain, chiefly Arabs and Berbers.
Minorca seems to have been ruled during a long
period by a Moorish family, son succeeding father,
with a title which the Spaniards called Almojarife.
We have already seen how, after the conquest of
Majorca, King Jayme secured the submission of
the Minorcan Moors by a stratagem.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> The great
king, however, dealt very leniently with the
smaller island. The government of Minorca was
confirmed to the Almojarife and his family on
condition of loyalty to the Aragonese overlord
and payment of tribute. This arrangement continued
until the usurpation of young Alfonso III.,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
a very different man from his illustrious grandfather.
The Moors were established in Minorca
for nearly four centuries; but, by the use of
ruthless methods, it is not difficult to extirpate a
whole population and to substitute another in so
small an island.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span></p>

<h2 id="II_CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="medium table">Conquest of Minorca by Alfonso III.&mdash;The Barbary pirates</span></h2>

<p>The young King Alfonso III. of Aragon, having
usurped the government of Majorca, as has been
related in the story of that island,<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> came to a sudden
determination to drive the Moors out of Minorca.
He made a pretext that the Almojarife had
thwarted his father’s designs on the coast of
Barbary by giving early information to his co-religionists.
Alfonso also said that when his
uncle’s dominions were restored to him, the
acquisition of Minorca would make up for the
temporary deprivation. This hopeful young king
had not begun well. He was unjust, wayward,
and sometimes cruel. He acted on the spur of
the moment. Had he lived, the promised son-in-law
of the great King Edward of England might
have become a more stable and right-minded
prince. At this time he cared very little for a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
pretext in making war, and his resolutions were
very hastily formed.</p>

<p>The consequence was that he chose the stormiest
period of the winter for his expedition, sending
to his brother Fadrique, in Sicily, to supply him
with forty well-armed galleys. He then assembled
the nobles of his kingdom at Tarragona, and was
granted five hundred cavalry and a large army
of <i>almogavares</i>.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The fleet of armed ships and
transports numbered 120 sail. En Pedro Cornel
was appointed general of the forces, and knights
of the families of Luna, Entenza, Anglesola accompanied
the King. Garcia Gorcas de Aracuri of
Aragon and Acart de Mur of Catalonia were
masters of the camp.</p>

<p>The terrible news reached the Almojarife<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> of
Minorca. His consternation was great, for the
danger was imminent. The impulsive young king
cared less than nothing for the written grant
given by En Jayme to the Moorish chief. The
Almojarife sent to Barbary to entreat for help
from the chiefs of Bugia, Bona, Tremecen, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
Constantia. In a short time 900 cavalry and
5,000 foot soldiers arrived from Africa, which
would enable the Moors to face their enemies with
a respectable force.</p>

<p>The King of Aragon left Salou with his fleet,
arriving at Majorca on December 2, 1285, where
he passed Christmas. Muntaner tells us that the
cold of that winter was intense, and that a man
might as well have been in the frozen steppes of
the Don. The hands of some of the oarsmen were
frostbitten, and the troops suffered from the
severity of the winter.</p>

<p>After the Christmas festivities were over, the
King ordered the fleet to make sail in the worst
possible weather. The ships were scarcely clear
of the land when a furious gale sprang up and
scattered the fleet. Alfonso arrived at Port Mahon
with only twenty galleys, and occupied one of the
rocky islands in the harbour, waiting for the rest
of his forces.</p>

<p>The Moors were ready to receive him. They
had a large army, composed partly of the auxiliaries
sent from Africa and partly of natives of the
island. Seeing them drawn up in battle array,
the impetuous young King resolved to attack
them without waiting for reinforcements. He had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
a few companies of <i>almogavares</i> and four hundred
horse. A very desperate and well-contested battle
was the result. Alfonso was in the thick of the
fight, giving many proofs of valour and dexterity
as a swordsman. In spite of the great inferiority
in numbers, the Catalans were victorious, the
Moors retreating in confusion to a hill which,
owing to the great slaughter, received the name of
‘El Degollador.’ The battlefield was situated
on a plain a little to the westward of the present
castle of San Felipe.</p>

<p>A day or two afterwards there was another fight,
owing to the conduct of a young knight named
Berenguer de Tornamira, who, to show his own
valour, attacked the Moors without orders with
a small force. If succour had not been promptly
despatched he would certainly have been overwhelmed.
As it was, the Moors were driven back.
The Almojarife then took refuge, with the remnant
of his forces, in the castle on Mount Santa
Agueda. Alfonso, always hasty and violent,
ordered Tornamira’s head to be cut off; but he
afterwards yielded to the prayers and remonstrances
of his nobles and consented to spare the
young knight’s life. The losses in these two
battles were very heavy, especially on the side of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
the Moors. By this time the rest of the fleet,
with troops on board, had arrived at Port Mahon.</p>

<p>Alfonso then advanced to the castle of Santa
Agueda, and made preparations for a siege; but
the Almojarife saw that all hope was gone, and
sent four of his principal ministers to ask for the
acceptance of the terms he offered. They were
that he would surrender the castle and the whole
island if he and his people were provided with
shipping to proceed to Barbary, paying 7-1/2 <i>doblas</i>
a head for every Moorish man or woman that
embarked. The Almojarife also asked to be
allowed to take his books, clothes, and fifty swords.
The ship was to take him to Ceuta or some other
port in Africa. The King consented to the terms,
and his favourite, Blasco Jimenes de Ayerba,
was instructed to make the necessary arrangement.
There was a Genoese vessel at Port Mahon,
which was hired and supplied with provisions,
and the unfortunate chief, with his family and
about a hundred other people who were able to
pay the ransom, embarked. Whether the ship
went down in a gale of wind, or whether there
was foul play, no one will ever know. It is certain
that she never was heard of again. The story of
Carbonell that the unfortunate fugitives were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
thrown overboard by order of the King, after
paying their ransoms, need not be believed.</p>

<p>The rest of the population was at the mercy
of the conquerors, to the number of about twenty
thousand. They were either forced to work at
the new buildings ordered to be erected, or sent
to Sicily and Barcelona to be sold as slaves.</p>

<p>The date of the capitulation was January 17,
1288, St. Anthony’s Day, which was ever afterwards
kept as a holiday, with processions and
other festivities. Alfonso remained in Minorca
until the following March, leaving orders for a
town to be built, with a fortified wall, at Port
Mahon. He died three years afterwards at
Barcelona, aged twenty-seven.</p>

<p>Don Juan Ramis y Ramis, the chronicler of
Minorca, recorded the prowess of the young King
and the conquest of the island in a poem entitled
‘Alonsiada.’</p>

<p>Pedro de Lesbia, a native of Valencia, was
left as the first Christian Procurator-General of
Minorca. The whole Moorish population appears
to have been rooted out of the island and replaced
by Catalan settlers. Ciudadela, at the western
end, became the capital, as it was in Moorish times;
while Port Mahon was the principal commercial port.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span></p>

<p>In a small island like Minorca a population
could soon be extirpated by ruthless invaders
without pity or remorse and actuated by unreasoning
bigotry. Their cruelties were not only condoned
but encouraged by their priests. It is a
revolting picture. There was an industrious and
happy people, engaged in cultivating a not very
grateful soil, which needed much toil and no
little skill to induce it to yield harvests sufficient
for the wants of a frugal population. In homes
endeared to them by centuries of occupation, and
surrounded by their wives and children, they were
living in peace and comparative prosperity, and
enjoying the hard-earned fruits of their toil. The
land tax, paid in kind, was the regular source
of revenue in all Muhammadan countries. In
Minorca the Almojarife, or collector, appears to
have been the hereditary chief of the island.
Suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, in a few days
total destruction came upon them. Thousands
were killed, all their chief men with their families
disappeared, all their property was seized, wives
were torn from husbands, children from parents,
and sold into slavery.</p>

<p>Turning away from the horrors of this scene of
cruelty and wrong, we may assume an interval of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
confusion, and then the farms and villages of the
Moors are occupied by Catalan families equally
industrious and hard-working. The Christians
were exposed to heavier exactions and suffered
under a less enlightened rule, so that perhaps
we should give them even greater credit than
their predecessors for the way in which they
extracted the means of supporting themselves
and their families from the stony fields.</p>

<p>Minorca continued to share the fortunes of
the larger island under her own kings, under the
Kings of Aragon, and under the Austrian dynasty
of Spain. The form of government was the same
as that granted to Majorca by En Jayme.</p>

<p>The smaller island suffered equally with
Majorca from the raids of Barbary pirates, who
carried off many unfortunate people into slavery.
All the islanders rejoiced at the campaign against
Tunis, led by the Emperor Charles V. in person,
who liberated several thousands of Christian slaves
in 1535. Yet the piracies did not cease, or only
for a time. Barbarossa, the piratical leader,
undeterred by the fall of Tunis, fitted out a fleet
of eleven galleys and made sail for the Balearic
Islands. His fleet entered Port Mahon with
Christian banners flying, to deceive the soldiers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
in the fort and the inhabitants, who were completely
taken in. Bells were rung and guns fired in
honour of what was supposed to be a part of the
Emperor’s fleet. A boat with some Franciscan
friars approached the galleys and discovered the
mistake. They pulled back to the shore, raised
a warning, and the gates of the town were
closed.</p>

<p>Barbarossa landed 2,500 Moors and some guns,
with which he battered the walls of the town and
made a breach. His assault was, however, repulsed.
The people of Ciudadela assembled three
hundred men, but seeing that the enemy was so
powerful they did not venture upon an attack at
first. They sent a messenger to warn the besieged
that they should be ready to make a sortie when
the relief approached. Then most of the three
hundred advanced, and occupied the attention
of the enemy while the besieged hastily repaired
the breaches in the walls. A second assault was
gallantly repulsed, and the pirate chief began to
feel rather insecure at Port Mahon, expecting the
return of the Emperor’s fleet from Tunis.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Barbarossa, the besieged lost
heart and surrendered the town to him on terms
which he never dreamt of keeping. He made
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
slaves of eight hundred of the inhabitants. The
churches were pillaged and profaned. The
Guardian of San Francisco had partaken of the
Sacrament to save the Host from profanation.
The Moors entered and seized all the valuables,
but did not find the Host in the pyx. Barbarossa
asked where it was, and when the Franciscan
replied that he had eaten it to preserve it from
profanation, he was ordered out for execution and
suffered death with two other friars.</p>

<p>This was in the year 1536. The Governor of
the island had remained at Ciudadela, and when
six citizens arrived from Port Mahon, who had
been released by Barbarossa because they advised
the surrender, the Governor ordered them to be
put to death. Barbarossa and his Moors evacuated
Port Mahon and departed with his plunder and
with many wretched people to be sold into slavery.
The Emperor was greatly distressed at these
repeated acts of piracy, and in 1541 he fitted out
a second expedition, this time against Algiers.
Again he led the expedition in person; but it was
a failure owing to the furious gales and deluges of
rain.</p>

<p>The islands were kept in a constant state of
alarm. In 1558 a Turkish fleet of 140 vessels
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
hove in sight. Ciudadela and Port Mahon had
been put in the best possible posture of defence,
when fifteen thousand Turks were landed, under
a leader named Mustapha. Having occupied the
open country, they laid siege to Ciudadela, which
was held by a garrison of seven hundred men.
A battery of artillery was planted against the
walls, and, after making a breach, three assaults
were delivered and gallantly repulsed. The besieged
Minorcans were resolved to defend the
place to the death, and they would have done so
if it had not been for a disastrous accident. The
magazine caught fire and all their powder was
destroyed. The men proposed to their leaders,
Arquimbau, the Lieutenant-Governor, and Captain
Noyet, to attempt to fight their way to Port Mahon.
They came out, the men of Alayor and Mercadal
leading, women and children in the centre, and the
rest of the garrison bringing up the rear, under
Arquimbau. The Turks attacked them furiously,
and only 150 got back into the town. On July 10
another assault was delivered, and at last the
place was taken. Many of the besieged were
killed in cold blood, and the rest were carried off
to be sold as slaves. On the same day the Turks
embarked and made sail.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>The Viceroy, Don Guillermo Rocafull, was not
in the island. He returned at once and proceeded
to repair the fortifications of Ciudadela,
bringing several families to re-people the place
from Majorca and Valencia. The castle of San
Felipe at Port Mahon was also repaired and
strengthened.</p>

<p>The piracies continued until well into the
eighteenth century, and kept the people in a
constant state of terror and alarm; but confidence
slowly returned, and Minorca had long been free
from actual invasion when the War of the Succession
broke out, after the death of Charles II., the
last of the Austrian Kings of Spain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span></p>

<h2 id="II_CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="medium table">British occupation of Minorca.</span></h2>

<p>The people of Spain had long been misgoverned,
impoverished, and oppressed when the last king of
the House of Austria died and left the War of
Succession as a legacy to his subjects.</p>

<p>The descendant of Maria Teresa, sister of
Charles II. and wife of Louis XIV. of France,
would have had the best right if her marriage had
not been allowed on condition of the most solemn
renunciation of the crown of Spain for the offspring
of it. The next heir was the Emperor
Leopold I., descended from a sister of Philip IV.
of Spain, the father of Charles II. He resigned his
claim to his second son, the Archduke Charles.
Strongly in favour of the Austrian claim, the unhappy
King was forced by priestly threats on his
deathbed to sign a will declaring Philip, Duke of
Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV. and Maria Teresa,
to be heir to the Spanish monarchy. Philip was
then seventeen. The Archduke Charles was fifteen.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<p>Louis XIV. was strictly pledged to the Governments
of England and Holland not to allow his
grandson to succeed. In February 1701, in
defiance of this solemn compact, Philip was
sent to Madrid and proclaimed as Philip V.
Castille acknowledged him. Aragon, Catalonia,
and the Balearic Islands declared for the Archduke
Charles as Charles III. He was supported
by England, Holland, Portugal, Savoy, and the
Empire. War was declared on May 15, 1702, and
the War of the Spanish Succession commenced.
In March 1704 Charles III. arrived at Lisbon with
four thousand Dutch and eight thousand English
troops, where he was joined by Don Juan
Henriquez, Admiral of Castille, one of the greatest
of the Spanish nobles. On August 3 Gibraltar was
taken, and garrisoned with two thousand men, the
Prince of Hesse Darmstadt being the first Governor.
Charles III. then proceeded to Barcelona, the
almost impregnable castle of Monjuich having
previously been captured by the Earl of Peterborough.
Amidst great rejoicings Charles made
his public entry on October 23, 1705. Peterborough
entered Valencia in triumph on February 4,
1706, and Majorca declared for King Charles.</p>

<p>General Stanhope was appointed Envoy Extraordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
to King Charles and sent out in command
of reinforcements. He was a grandson of the
first Earl of Chesterfield and son of Alexander
Stanhope, who was Ambassador at Madrid in the
time of Charles II. Having passed his youth in
his father’s house, he was well acquainted with
Spanish and with the feelings of the people. He
learnt the art of war under Marlborough.</p>

<p>The disastrous battle of Almanza was fought
in April 1707, and for some time the cause of
King Charles seemed almost hopeless. The Duke
of Berwick entered Valencia and conquered
Aragon, the French claimant, Philip, abolishing
all its provincial privileges; while General Stanhope
was reduced to a strictly defensive system.
King Charles’s base was the east coast of Spain
and the Mediterranean Sea. The English fleet
was therefore of the utmost importance, and it
became very urgent that the ships should remain
out, instead of returning home for the winter.
But, although Majorca was for Charles, the harbour
of Port Mahon was still occupied by French and
Spanish troops for Philip.</p>

<p>Stanhope, with his German colleague Staremburg,
after several weeks of skilful but desultory
manœuvres, obliged the French army to retreat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
from Tortosa, to which place the enemy had
advanced. In August of the same year, 1707,
Admiral Leake with the British fleet took Cagliari
and secured the island of Sardinia for King Charles.
But the most important enterprise was the capture
of Minorca with its excellent harbour.</p>

<p>The Duke of Marlborough wrote to General
Stanhope saying: ‘I am so entirely convinced
that nothing can be done effectually without the
fleet, that I conjure you, if possible, to take Port
Mahon.’ Lord Godolphin sent out instructions
to the same effect, which reached Stanhope when
he was encamped at Cervera with Marshal Staremburg,
at the close of the campaign against the
French.</p>

<p>Stanhope immediately set out for Barcelona
in pursuance of his instructions, but few men
could be spared for the enterprise. Fortunately,
Charles was fully alive to its great importance.
Admiral Sir John Leake was still off Sardinia
with the bulk of the fleet. There were, however,
six men-of-war at Barcelona; but some of the
captains hesitated to take any responsibility. The
two who supported the General were his brother
Philip of the <i>Milford</i>, and Trevanion of the
<i>York</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span></p>

<p>Stanhope forced their hands by actually embarking
in some transports the troops he had
been able to collect, and announcing his intention
of proceeding at once to Majorca, there to await
reinforcements. This made all the captains resolve
to accompany him. One of the ships (the
<i>Milford</i>) was commanded by the General’s brother,
Captain Philip Stanhope, and the two brothers
sailed together. The force consisted of 1,200
British troops, including marines, 600 Portuguese,
and the rest Spanish. The General wrote to Sir
John Leake, who had just reduced Sardinia to
obedience to Charles, sending a copy of the letter
from Lord Godolphin, and entreating him to
co-operate.</p>

<p>Sir John Leake was about to return with the
Beet to England for the winter, leaving a squadron
to guard the Portuguese coast. He, however, left
Pula, near Cagliari, with the fleet on August 18,
in compliance with General Stanhope’s request,
and arrived off Port Mahon on the 25th. He
cruised off the island until September 14, when
Stanhope arrived on board the <i>Milford</i>, the transports
following on October 3.</p>

<p>Stanhope’s plan was to land at once and lay
siege to the castle of San Felipe. Measures were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
accordingly arranged with the Admiral, who lent
all the marines and guns that could be spared.
There were forty-two guns and thirteen mortars.
A spot was selected about two miles from the
castle to the south-west, and the troops were
landed. All the inhabitants received them
joyfully, declaring for King Charles; and the
magistrates of Mahon came and delivered up the
keys of their city. On the 7th the <i>Dunkirk</i>,
<i>Centurion</i>, and <i>York</i> were anchored near the
south-east point of the island, to cover the landing
of the heavy guns. This was a service of great
difficulty, for the only place for landing them
was in a creek within half gunshot of the enemy’s
batteries. Nevertheless it was attempted that
very evening, and effected with little loss. The
country was found to be rocky and without
roads, and the beasts of burden that could be
obtained were so few that it was twelve days
before the guns could be got into position ready
to commence the attack.</p>

<p>On the 8th the fleet, consisting of fifteen sail
of the line, under the command of Sir John Leake,
sailed for England. The Admiral had lent the
General as many marines as could possibly be
spared, and supplied him with ammunition and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
some provisions. A squadron of seventeen sail
was left off Port Mahon, under the command of
Sir Edward Whitaker, the hero of Gibraltar, to
assist in the reduction of the castle of San Felipe.</p>

<p>Two ships, the <i>Dunkirk</i> (Captain Butler) and
<i>Centurion</i> (Captain Fairborn), were detached to
take possession of the castle and harbour of
Fornelle, on the north coast of the island. The
<i>Dunkirk</i> arrived two hours before the <i>Centurion</i>,
and opened a heavy fire, which was returned with
some effect; but when the <i>Centurion</i> also hove
in sight, the garrison surrendered as prisoners of
war. All the transports and bomb-vessels were
then sent to Fornelle creek, having previously
had no secure place to ride in.</p>

<p>On the 28th General Stanhope opened a
battery of nine guns on two towers flanking an
outer line, which the garrison of San Felipe had
lately thrown up, beating them down and making
some breaches in the connecting walls. This was
not difficult, as the works had been hastily
run up with loose stones. Brigadier Lane was
stationed on the right with two battalions. Captain
Philip Stanhope commanded the marines. Some
of Wade’s men entered a breach in the wall without
orders, and as soon as he saw their advance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
he followed with all his men. Philip Stanhope
led on his marines, and there was a general advance,
the garrison, after a short resistance, abandoning
all the outworks and retreating into the castle.
Next morning the enemy commenced a parley,
which was followed by their capitulation in the
afternoon. They could have held out for a long
time. A hundred pieces of ordnance were found
in the castle, three thousand barrels of powder,
and all things necessary for a long defence. The
victory was dearly bought with the death of
Captain Philip Stanhope, who fell mortally
wounded. He was struck by a ball on the forehead
as he was held up by two sailors to look
over a wall seven feet high. He was interred in
one of the vaults of the castle. The General wrote:
‘The conquest has cost me very dear, but since
Philip died in doing service to Her Majesty and
his country, I shall think his life well bestowed,
as I should my own.’</p>

<p>Ciudadela at once surrendered, and its garrison
of a hundred men became prisoners of war. There
was no resistance in any other part of the island.
Stanhope wrote: ‘A great part of our success in
reducing this island is owing to the zeal and
affection the people have for us, which is beyond
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
expression.’ Port Mahon was garrisoned by
British marines, and the fortifications were
strengthened by new works at a cost of about
60,000<i>l.</i> It was General Stanhope’s idea that
Minorca should be held as a sort of mortgage for
the large sums advanced to King Charles.</p>

<p>A medal was struck at the Tower to commemorate
the conquests of Sardinia and Minorca.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>Obv.</i>: Bust of Queen Anne.</p>

<p><i>Rev.</i>: Victory holding a palm-branch in one hand,
and the Union Jack in the other. Two islands appearing
in the distance, ‘<span class="smcap">SARDINIA ET BALEARIS MINOR CAPT&AElig;.</span>’</p>

<p><i>Exergue</i>: <span class="smcap">MDCCVII.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Stanhope returned to his military duties in
Spain. He was at Barcelona again on November 9.
It is not necessary to follow the course of events.
The death of the Emperor Joseph I. in 1711
opened the succession to his brother Charles;
while his want of success and the animosity of the
Castilians destroyed all chance of his succeeding
to the crown of Spain. In fact, he became
Emperor of Germany as Charles VI.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Harley and St. John opened
negotiations for peace. The abandonment of the
Catalans and Majorcans to their fate cast an
indelible stain of infamy on the British Government.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Queen Anne had several times pledged her
royal word for the preservation of the lives and
liberties of the Catalans. In consequence of those
promises the Catalans had begun and maintained
an insurrection. Yet no stipulation was made
in the treaty, and St. John had the effrontery to
announce that ‘it is not for the interests of
England to preserve the Catalan liberties.’</p>

<p>On April 11, 1713, the Peace of Utrecht was
signed, the Emperor Charles refusing to be a party
to it. The French Prince was acknowledged as
King of Spain, being Philip V. of that country,
but resigning any right of succession to the French
crown. The Duke of Savoy was to have Sicily;
Gibraltar and Minorca were ceded to England;
the Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to
the Emperor. Lord Stanhope, the descendant of
the conqueror of Minorca, has pleaded with some
truth that, whilst the glories of the war belong to
the whole British people, the disgrace of the peace,
the unworthy result of such great achievements,
rests on a small knot of factious politicians.</p>

<p>Their beloved King Charles, now Emperor of
Germany, must be acquitted of blame as regards
the Catalans and Majorcans. He was powerless.
Writing to General Stanhope, he said: ‘Knowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
as I do your goodness of heart, I am persuaded
that you and your friends will compassionate the
fidelity, firmness, and misfortune of my poor
Catalans. No difficulties, no dangers, no temptations
could shake their generous loyalty. All this
pierces my heart. I leave you to judge whether
it is in my power to aid them without a naval
force. I doubt not that you will consider the
dreadful state to which they have been reduced
by the evil-minded men of your country, contrary
to the most solemn and repeated engagements.’</p>

<p>Catalonia and Majorca were abandoned to the
mean vengeance of Philip. Minorca was more
fortunate in becoming a British possession. In
1717 the conqueror of Minorca was created
Viscount Stanhope of Mahon.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<h2 id="II_CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="medium table">Minorca as a base</span></h2>

<p>Minorca was the chief gainer by the Peace of
Utrecht. She secured many years of good government
and freedom from oppression by her connection
with her English friends. But England
herself derived almost equal advantage. She
had become a Mediterranean Power. She had
Gibraltar, but it was necessary that she should
also have a base within the inland sea where
her ships could refit and her sailors could be
refreshed; and this need was supplied in full
measure by the splendid harbour of Port Mahon.
The value of such a possession was experienced a
very few years after the peace.</p>

<p>The Emperor had sent an army into Hungary
against the Turks, and Philip V. gave a solemn
promise to the Pope that he would not undertake
anything against the interests of the Emperor
while he was engaged in so religious a cause. Yet,
without regard to this promise and in defiance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
the duties imposed upon him by the treaty of
peace, he sent a fleet, with a land force of nine
thousand men, from Barcelona, which seized upon
the island of Sardinia in July 1717. His excuse
was that King Charles had delivered up the towns
in Catalonia and Majorca to the inhabitants, thus
putting Philip to the trouble and expense of
reducing those people to obedience.</p>

<p>In consequence of this aggression, the Powers
made a treaty, called the Quadruple Alliance, by
which the Emperor was to give up his claim to
the crown of Spain, to receive Sicily from the
Duke of Savoy, and to give him Sardinia in its
place, with the title of King. Philip would not
agree to this arrangement and continued his
preparations for war, without any regard to the
remonstrances of England and even of France. In
this he was strongly influenced by his second wife
and by his Minister, Cardinal Alberoni.</p>

<p>In order to prevent farther mischief in the
Mediterranean a formidable fleet was got ready at
Spithead, under the command of Admiral Sir
George Byng, with orders to hinder and resist all
attempts of Spain against Italy or Sicily. Byng
sailed on June 25, 1718, with twenty ships of the
line, two fire-ships, two bomb-ships, a hospital-ship,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
and a store-ship. Off Cape St. Vincent he
sent a messenger, by way of Cadiz, to convey a
letter to Lord Harrington, the British Envoy at
Madrid, that the Spanish Government might be
informed of the approach of the British fleet and
of Byng’s instructions.</p>

<p>The Envoy showed the letter to Cardinal
Alberoni, who declared that his master would
run all hazards rather than recall his fleet and
troops, that the Spaniards would not be frightened,
and that he had no fear of the result if Admiral
Byng attacked them. The Envoy then requested
his Eminence to look over a list of the British
ships which he held in his hand. Alberoni snatched
it and threw it on the ground, trampling on it in a
great passion.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done with such
a violent diplomatist. The British fleet entered
the Mediterranean, and arrived at Port Mahon on
July 23. Here the Admiral landed four regiments,
and took the marines forming the old garrison to
serve in the fleet. On August 1 the Admiral
arrived at Naples, and conferred with Count
Daun, the very popular Viceroy for the Emperor
Charles VI. It was found that the Spaniards had
landed an army in Sicily and were besieging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Messina, and that there was a large Spanish fleet
there, consisting of twenty-nine ships of the line
and frigates, two being seventy-four-gun ships
and eight with sixty guns.</p>

<p>On August 9 Sir George Byng with his formidable
fleet arrived off Messina, and sent a letter
to the Spanish General proposing to him that he
should grant a cessation of hostilities for two
months, to give time for the Powers to agree to a
lasting peace, apprising him of his instructions in
case of refusal. The Spaniard replied that he
had no powers to treat, and that he would obey
his orders, which were to seize Sicily for the King
of Spain.</p>

<p>The Spanish fleet had weighed the day before,
and was out of sight to the south. Byng went in
chase, and before noon of the next day he came
in sight of their twenty-seven men-of-war in order
of battle. Don Antonio de Castaneta was the
Admiral in command, and there were four rear-admirals,
one of them an Irish renegade named
Cammock. On sighting the English fleet they
stood away, but still in order of battle. All that
day and the succeeding night the English Admiral
followed them. Early in the morning of the 11th
one of the Spanish rear-admirals parted company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
with six frigates and all the galleys, bomb-vessels,
and store-ships, standing for the Sicilian coast
near Syracuse. Captain Walton of the <i>Canterbury</i>,
with five vessels under his command, was
detached in pursuit. Walton’s report of his proceedings
is a model of business-like brevity:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>‘<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;We have taken and destroyed all the
Spanish ships and vessels which were upon the
coast, the number as per margin.’</p></blockquote>

<p>Admiral Byng continued the pursuit of the
main fleet and came up with it off Cape Passaro.
The <i>Orford</i> and <i>Grafton</i> were the foremost ships,
and the Spaniards fired their stern chase guns.
The order was given not to return the fire unless it
was repeated. It was repeated, and the <i>Orford</i>
promptly engaged the <i>Santa Rosa</i>, of sixty-four
guns, and took her. Next the <i>San Carlos</i>, of
sixty guns, struck to the <i>Kent</i>. The <i>Principe de
Asturias</i>, with the flag of Rear-Admiral Chacon,
was dealt with by the <i>Breda</i> and <i>Captain</i>. The
Spanish Admiral’s flagship, of seventy-four guns,
made a running fight until 3 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span>, and then struck
to the <i>Superbe</i>. Three other ships were taken.
Sir George Byng employed the next few days
refitting and repairing damages in the prizes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
Nine of the Spanish ships escaped, thirteen were
taken and became prizes, three were burnt, three
sunk. Practically the Spanish fleet ceased to
exist.</p>

<p>The value of Minorca as a base then became
apparent. Rear-Admiral Cornwall was sent to
Port Mahon with the ships that required repairs
and all the prizes. On February 3, 1719, Sir
George Byng went with the rest of the fleet to
Port Mahon, to refresh the men and refit the
ships. Returning to Naples in April, he found
that Count Mercy had been appointed to the
command of a German army to expel the Spaniards
from Sicily. Mercy was a tall, soldier-like man,
but excessively short-sighted. He had great
strength of mind and body, was very ambitious,
with an insatiable thirst for glory. He would
have been a greater general if he had been endowed
with a cooler temper. The task before him was
a difficult one, although the English fleet gave
him command of the sea. All things being ready,
Sir George Byng sailed from Baia with eight
men-of-war, escorting two hundred transports
having on board 10,000 infantry and 3,500 horse.
By the advice of the Savoyard Governor of
Melazzo, the landing was effected on the coast
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
about twenty miles to the westward of that
fortress. Count Seckendorf was detached to
reduce the Lipari Islands to the Emperor’s obedience&mdash;an
important matter, so as to keep the
communications open between Naples and Sicily.</p>

<p>The Sicilian campaign commenced in May
1719, and there was some very severe fighting.
Count Mercy found himself in considerable difficulties
in the interior; for the natives were on
the side of the Spaniards. He sent a message
with an urgent request that Sir George Byng
would come to him for a consultation. The
Admiral did not hesitate. He set out with a
strong escort, accompanied by his eldest son and
Captain Matthews of the <i>Kent</i>. The road was
strewn with the dead bodies of men and horses,
and was very rugged, but they reached the Count’s
tent in the evening. A guard of honour was
drawn up for the Admiral’s reception, and one of
the men was shot through the head at the door of
the tent by a musket-ball from the enemy’s camp.
He fell dead at the Admiral’s feet as he dismounted.
Sir George found the Count very weak
from a wound, the ball not having yet been extracted.
But he was full of pluck, and desirous
of again attacking the Spaniards in their strong
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
position, though his officers advised a retreat to
the coast. A council next day confirmed this
opinion, and dwelt on the urgency of receiving
reinforcements. Sir George therefore returned to
the coast and immediately proceeded with two
ships to Naples to represent the state of things
to the Viceroy. He then returned to Sicily, where
he found that Count Mercy had been disabled
by an apoplectic seizure; but that his second in
command had taken Taormina by surprise and
advanced to Messina, where the siege was commenced
on July 20. The town surrendered and
Sir George Byng took his fleet into the harbour,
but the citadel held out.</p>

<p>The Emperor had resolved to send troops
from Milan, by way of Genoa, to reinforce Count
Mercy, and, knowing the extreme slowness of the
Germans, the Admiral resolved to superintend the
business personally. On August 23 he returned
to Naples, arriving at Genoa on September 7.
He found everything extremely backward. After
much worry and almost incredible trouble, what
with persuasion and threats, he got seven thousand
men on board the transports and brought them
to Messina. The whole army was overjoyed to
see a man who always brought them relief and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
succour. Count Mercy had returned from Reggio,
but with the ball not yet extracted. He was
delighted at the Admiral’s success in bringing him
help. It decided the fate of the citadel, which
surrendered after a siege of ninety-one days.
The Spanish General then fortified the almost
impregnable position at Castro Giovanni; but
Count Mercy and the Admiral thought it more
important to occupy Palermo, and while operations
for that purpose were being pushed forward
the Spaniards offered to evacuate Sicily on terms.</p>

<p>Early in 1720 the news arrived that Philip V.
had given up his ambitious projects and joined the
Quadruple Alliance. Sicily and Sardinia were to
be evacuated by the Spaniards within two months.
During May and June the Spanish troops were
embarked in transports at Termini and sent to
Barcelona. The Duke of Savoy was then put
into quiet possession of Sardinia. Thus the work
was completed for the execution of which the
British fleet under Sir George Byng had been sent
to the Mediterranean. The English Admiral certainly
deserves the highest credit. He was
diligent in preparing his measures, attending to
every detail himself. In action he was alike
careful and energetic. His patience under the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
most trying circumstances was inexhaustible. He
was most successful as a diplomatist, and at
length he acquired such influence that he was
looked to as an umpire in the numerous misunderstandings
and disputes of rival commanders.
Thus the service that was entrusted to him, a
most harassing and difficult service, was performed
with remarkable ability and complete
success. On his return he was created Viscount
Torrington, and in 1733 he died in harness as
First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

<p>Minorca played an unostentatious but very
important part in this campaign. Without that
base for refitting the ships and refreshing the
men the difficulties of Admiral Byng would have
been increased tenfold.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span></p>

<h2 id="II_CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="medium table">Minorca under British rule</span></h2>

<p>If the occupation of Minorca was very important
to the British as a base for their fleet, it was an
even greater blessing to the inhabitants. While
the ancient rights and liberties of the Catalans
and Majorcans were ruthlessly destroyed by their
Bourbon conqueror, the Minorcans were treated
very differently. Their religion, their form of
civil government, their customs and traditions
were all respected by the English, who came as
friends rather than as masters. It will be interesting
to glance over the condition of the island
during the earlier years of British occupation.</p>

<p>Minorca was divided into five provinces, called
<i>terminos</i>. At the eastern end was the <i>termino</i> of
Mahon with the capital under British rule, and
at the western the <i>termino</i> of Ciudadela, the
ancient capital. Between them were the <i>terminos</i>
of Alaior, Mercadal, and Fererias, each with its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
chief village of the same name. Mercadal included
the greater part of the northern coast.</p>

<p>The principal feature of the island is the
splendid harbour of Port Mahon, with deep water,
and capable in former days of sheltering all the
fleets of Europe. There are several small islands
in the harbour, and on one the hospital was built
when Sir John Jennings was Commander-in-Chief
in the Mediterranean, 1711-13. The quarantine
station was on another island. The picturesque
town of Mahon, built entirely of freestone, rose
up the side of a hill, with its great church and
monasteries showing above the roofs of the houses.
The streets were rocky and narrow, but the site
was fresh and healthy. Along the waterside
there was a long quay, one end being reserved
for the navy and naval stores, and the other for
trading vessels and merchandise.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the harbour is the castle of
San Felipe, on a neck of land between Port Mahon
and St. Stephen’s Cove. The main fort consisted
of four bastions connected by curtains, with a
deep ditch hewn out of the solid rocks. Within
the area there were the Governor’s house, barracks,
guard-room, and chapel. In the centre
there was a pump to supply the troops with rain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
water from a large cistern. The whole rock is
undermined with subterranean passages and
chambers. A considerable suburb, including barracks
and officers’ quarters, rose up outside the
castle. The plain beyond is stony and barren,
but at the head of St. Stephen’s Cove there is a
<i>barranco</i> or ravine, bounded by rocks on either
side, where there are fruit trees and garden vegetables
of all kinds. These <i>barrancos</i> are the fertile
and fruit-yielding parts of the island. Originally
long creeks penetrating into the land from the sea,
they have been gradually filled with rich soil by
floods from the hills on the north side, until they
were raised above the sea level. There is no tide
to carry off the deposits brought down from the
hills. At the upper end of the harbour there is
another extensive <i>barranco</i>, known as the gardens
of San Juan, which was the principal source of
supply of vegetables for Mahon. A few miles
farther north is the <i>albufera</i>, or salt lake, separated
from the sea by a sand-spit, and abounding in
fish; and still farther to the north are the harbour
and beautiful valley of Adaia. Wild pigeons and
rabbits frequent the rocky cliffs and islands on
the coast.</p>

<p>The interior of the island is barren and stony,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
except for the <i>barrancos</i>. Alaior was a tolerably
well-built town on an eminence; but Mercadal
and Fererias are only wretched villages. The
north coast is deeply indented, and Port Fornelle
is a large harbour.</p>

<p>Ciudadela, at the head of an inlet on the
western coast, was the capital in the time of the
Moors, and continued to be so during the Aragonese
and Austrian rule. It was then the place of
residence of the Governor, and was a flourishing
and well-built town. Vessels of small draft,
trading with Majorca and Barcelona, came up
the inlet and supplied the island with foreign
goods. The wall which encircled Ciudadela dates
from the time of the Moors, to which more modern
fortifications had been added. In the <i>plaza</i> was
the Government House and the <i>Lonja</i>, or exchange,
an ancient building raised on lofty Gothic arches.
Thence a passage led to a postern and, by a long
flight of stone steps, to the quay. The cathedral
is in the centre of the town, and the largest religious
edifice in the island, with a square tower and spire,
all of freestone. It probably dates from the
thirteenth century. Near the Mahon gate was a
large convent of Austin friars, where there used
to be public arguments on the philosophy of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
schools. There was an extensive Franciscan convent,
and a nunnery of Santa Clara. A fine
<i>barranco</i> to the north supplied Ciudadela with
fruit and vegetables.</p>

<p>The people of the island were well housed in
solid stone buildings, the farmhouses being generally
of two storeys, with the granary under the
roof. The farmers have to contend against frequent
and violent gales, a very stony and shallow
soil, and scarcity of water. They are very
laborious, and work under a system of partnership.
There is an equal division of produce
between landlord and tenant, the landlord finding
buildings, implements, and cattle, the tenant seeds
and labour. Very few landlords cultivate their
own land.</p>

<p>The government of the island was on the model
of that of Majorca, as established by En Jayme I.
The Courts of Justice were removed from Ciudadela
to Port Mahon by the English; otherwise no
change was made in the civil government, which
was left in the hands of the natives. The magistrates
were called Jurats, so many in each Termino;
and their duties were to impose taxes, see that
the markets were properly supplied, and lay the
hardships or grievances of the people before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
Governor. These Jurats were chosen from all
ranks. The Jurat-Major was a gentleman, his
colleagues being chosen from merchants, artisans,
and peasants&mdash;one from each class. They were
elected for a year. The Jurats of the island,
with the consent of the Governor, could call a
General Council of their body, consisting of twenty-four
members, which met at Ciudadela. Their
business was to settle the taxes and decide upon
the incidence of taxation, as well as to provide for
special contingencies and to represent grievances.
Besides the Jurats, there was a Bayle or Judge,
who held a court and decided cases, there being
an appeal to the supreme court at Port Mahon.
The ecclesiastical court was held by the Vicar-General
at Ciudadela. There were five parishes,
and the Curas received tithes, the other clergy
being supported by Masses, fees, and collections.
In 1713 there were on the island 75 secular clergy,
140 friars, and 85 nuns&mdash;in all 300; a tolerably
large proportion for a population of 27,000.</p>

<p>Under British rule there was an end to the
oppression and peculation of Governors sent to
the island to mend their broken fortunes; justice
was properly administered, and trade flourished.
The condition of the people visibly improved
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
during Sir Robert Walpole’s long peace. The
island depended on foreign trade for a third of the
corn that was required, and all the oil and spirits,
besides other things. It was the English money circulated
by the troops that preserved the islanders
from bankruptcy, and indeed enabled them to live
in prosperity as compared with their former lot.</p>

<p>The English garrison used to consist of five
infantry regiments and a company of artillery, in
all 2,400 effective men. They were quartered at
San Felipe, Alaior, with a detachment at Fornelle,
and Ciudadela, the favourite quarters. The successive
Governors took an almost fatherly interest
in the island, and British rule continued to be very
popular.</p>

<p>One of the best Governors was Brigadier Kane,
who was many years ruling in Minorca, and who
died there. Soon after his arrival there was a
great scarcity of fresh provisions: the numbers of
sheep and bullocks had dwindled almost to nothing,
and chickens had also become scarce. Kane set
to work to remedy the evil with great energy.
He procured and imported herds of cattle and
flocks of sheep. He also got large supplies of
poultry from France, Italy, and the Barbary coast,
distributing them among the farmers and peasants;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
and he encouraged the people to set to work improving
their breeds. Kane also made an excellent
road for the whole length of the island, from
Ciudadela to Port Mahon.</p>

<p>The British occupation was not wholly without
permanent record, both as regards general history
and some scientific results. Mr. John Armstrong,
the Government Engineer, described the island,
its physical aspects, antiquities, people, and institutions
in a series of letters which were published
as ‘The History of the Island of Minorca’
in 1752. Dr. George Cleghorn resided for many
years on the island as Surgeon-Major to the garrison.
In 1751 he published his ‘Observations on the
Epidemical Diseases in Minorca,’ a work which
contains a list of 180 species of plants of the
island, with Latin, English, and Minorcan names.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span></p>

<p>The first period of British rule lasted for nearly
half a century, from 1708 to 1757, when there was
a catastrophe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<h2 id="II_CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />

<span class="medium table">Minorca twice lost</span></h2>

<p>The Seven Years’ War commenced in March
1756, and the first enterprise of the French was
designed against Minorca. The preparations at
Toulon were, however, concealed from a dull and
apathetic English Ministry by pretended activity
in the ports of the Channel, to instil a belief that
an invasion of England was intended. Newcastle
was Prime Minister, Anson at the Admiralty, and
Henry Fox Secretary of State. Pitt did not take
office until the following year. The English
Ministers were completely duped. Meanwhile the
French had got ready thirteen sail of the line and
fifteen thousand troops; and at last, when the
danger of losing Minorca became apparent, hurry
and confusion took the place of sloth and apathy.</p>

<p>Even then only ten ships were ordered to the
Mediterranean, incompletely manned and without
hospital or fire ships. The command was given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
to Admiral John Byng, fourth son of Lord
Torrington, who had served under his father on
board the <i>Superbe</i> at the defeat of the Spanish
fleet off Cape Passaro. Byng sailed from Spithead
on April 7, 1756, arriving at Gibraltar on May 2.
Here he found the <i>Louisa</i>, Captain Edgcombe, who
reported that he had been driven from Minorca
by a French fleet of thirteen sail of the line, commanded
by Admiral Galissoni&egrave;re, who had landed
the Duc de Richelieu on the island with fifteen
thousand men. Byng demanded a battalion of
infantry from General Fowke, the Governor of
Gibraltar, to reinforce the Minorca garrison. After
consulting a council of war, this demand was
refused by the Governor. There was one regiment,
commanded by Lord Robert Bertie, in the
fleet, and about thirty officers who had been on
leave, including General Stuart, Lord Effingham,
and Colonel Cornwallis, coming out to rejoin their
regiments at Minorca.</p>

<p>While Byng was on his way, General Blakeney,
the Governor of the island, was besieged by the
Due de Richelieu in the castle of San Felipe.
Byng sailed on May 8, and was off Majorca on
the 10th, where he was joined by the <i>Phœnix</i>
(Captain Hervey), who confirmed the news brought
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
by Captain Edgcomb to Gibraltar. Byng’s fleet
consisted of the&mdash;</p>

<p>On the 19th the British fleet was off Port Mahon.
Byng saw the Union Jack still flying on the castle
of San Felipe, but several French batteries were
bombarding the walls. His orders were to save
Minorca at all hazards. These orders were positive
and explicit, and it was his duty to carry them
out at whatever sacrifice. The sight of General
Blakeney still holding out and hoping for relief
would have aroused the ardour of most men. The
French fleet came in sight, and Byng stood towards
it, making the signal for line of battle ahead
at 2 <span class="smcap">P.M.</span> The French, being about two leagues
distant, tacked to gain the weather-gage, and
Byng did the same. Next morning was the 20th.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
It was hazy in the forenoon, but at noon it cleared,
and Byng made a signal to bear away two points
from the wind and engage the enemy.</p>

<p>Rear-Admiral West, with his division, bore
away seven points, and attacked the French fleet
with such impetuosity that several of their ships
were put out of action. The French centre kept
its position, and Byng did not advance. This
prevented West from following up his advantage.
If the Commander-in-Chief had shown equal zeal,
the French fleet would have been defeated and
Minorca saved. As it was, by holding back he
gave Admiral Galissoni&egrave;re time to retreat out of
danger. The wind enabled Byng to fight if he
would, when a complete victory would have been
the result. But he would not.</p>

<p>On the absurd plea that Gibraltar might be
in danger, Admiral Byng returned to that fortress,
and Galissoni&egrave;re took up his former station off
the entrance to Port Mahon. Blakeney and his
gallant companions were abandoned to their fate.
Nevertheless, they held out until June 28, after a
brave defence of ten weeks, when the Governor
surrendered to the Duc de Richelieu on very
honourable terms.</p>

<p>Admiral Byng arrived at Gibraltar on June 19,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
where he found Commodore Broderick with a
reinforcement of five ships of the line. The
Commander-in-Chief therefore resolved to return
to Minorca, and was making preparations for a
second attempt. In the midst of this tardy
activity the <i>Antelope</i> frigate arrived with Admirals
Hawke and Saunders and Lord Tyrawly on board.
Their orders were to supersede Admirals Byng
and West and Governor Fowke, and to send them
home under arrest. Sir Edward Hawke at once
sailed for Minorca, but found the French flag
flying over the castle of San Felipe. Admiral
Galissoni&egrave;re had retired to Toulon, and there was
nothing left to be done.</p>

<p>The people of England were furious at the
loss of Minorca, venting all their rage on the
unfortunate Admiral and none on the incapable
Ministry which had shown apathy and want of
foresight and capacity, and had neglected measures
which, if taken in time, would have made Port
Mahon safe from attack.</p>

<p>The prisoners arrived at Portsmouth in July.
Admiral West was graciously received by the
King and made a Lord of the Admiralty. General
Fowke was dismissed the service. Byng was
taken to Greenwich, where he remained a close
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
prisoner until December. He was then brought
back to Portsmouth, to be tried by court-martial.
The Court sat for a month. Admiral West
deposed that there was no reason why the rest
of the fleet should not have engaged the enemy
as closely as he did; also that there was no
signal for giving chase when the enemy retreated.
General Blakeney said that boats might have
passed between the garrison and the fleet, and
that if the troops ordered for his relief had
been landed he could have held out until the
arrival of Sir Edward Hawke. Captain Gardiner,
of the flagship, deposed that he advised the
Admiral to bear down on the enemy, but without
effect, and that the Admiral took command of
the <i>Ramillies</i> entirely upon himself on the day
of the action. The court found that he had not
done his utmost to destroy the ships of the enemy
that it was his duty to engage, but that this did
not proceed from want of courage or disaffection.</p>

<p>Lord Anson, the First Lord of the Admiralty,
resigned, and was succeeded by Lord Temple,
who had to discuss the sentence with George II.
He drew a parallel between Byng’s conduct at
Minorca and George’s own conduct at Oudenarde
in 1708; leaving the King to draw the necessary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
inference that if Byng deserved to be shot, George
deserved to be hanged. The King said afterwards:
‘Temple is so disagreeable a fellow that
there is no bearing him.’</p>

<p>Admiral West, when he found that it was in
tended to shoot Byng, resigned his seat at the
Admiralty. His evidence against Byng had been
damning, but he would not be a party to his
execution. Nor would he serve afloat under such
a Ministry, saying that ‘he was determined to
forego anything rather than serve on terms which
subject an officer to the treatment shown Admiral
Byng. He was not convicted of cowardice nor
of disaffection, but of misconduct, an offence
never till now thought capital.’ Admiral West
was of opinion that the word ‘negligence’ in the
Article of War was only intended to refer to one
of those two crimes, cowardice or disaffection&mdash;‘that
is, <i>negligence proceeding from cowardice or
disaffection</i>.’ He said that was the opinion of the
House of Commons when the Bill was before them.
Admiral Forbes, another Lord of the Admiralty,
who held similar views, resigned at the same
time.</p>

<p>Admiral Byng certainly deserved to be dismissed
from the service; but his execution was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
a political murder. He was shot on March 14,
1758, after eight months of close arrest. He had
forty years of naval service. George II. would
show no mercy, and there was a malignant
political clique whose neglect of duty would be
lost sight of through this persecution of a scape-goat
even unto death. The mistaken resentment
of a deluded populace was stimulated to the
utmost. The loss of Minorca was due quite as
much to the neglect of Ministers in not taking
earlier steps for its defence as to the misconduct
of Admiral Byng.</p>

<p>At the peace in 1763 Minorca was restored to
England, and enjoyed another nineteen years of
good government and prosperity, making altogether
sixty-seven years.</p>

<p>But when the American colonies broke out in
rebellion and the chief Powers of Europe seized
the opportunity to attack our country in its great
difficulty&mdash;first France, then Spain, then Holland,
England’s enemies, thought their opportunity
had come. They were mistaken, for England is
never greater than when surrounded by enemies.
She gave France her answer off Martinique;
France and Spain together in Gibraltar Bay.
But she could not be everywhere, and poor little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
Minorca was lost. While England was dealing
back such telling blows elsewhere, the French and
Spaniards landed, and laid siege to the castle of
San Felipe. Their leader, De Crillon, pushed on
the attack, but the English Governor, General
Murray, made a most gallant defence. It was
in 1782. Murray did not surrender until his
garrison was reduced to six hundred men, while
the besiegers had twelve thousand. It was
typical of the whole war&mdash;England standing
proudly at bay and dealing out far more than
she got, with rebels, French, Spaniards, Dutch, all
yelping round her. Peace was signed in 1783, but
Minorca was lost.</p>

<p>Don Luis Berton de los Balbs, Duke of Crillon,
Marquis of Valleron, and Count of St. Pol, was
made a Grandee of Spain and Duke of Mahon in
1790 for subduing six hundred English soldiers
by starvation with an army of twelve thousand
men. He died in 1796. The second Duke of
Mahon was Viceroy of Navarre for Joseph
Bonaparte, and a traitor to his country. His
niece Victoriana, Duchess of Mahon, succeeded
to all the titles, and was living in 1870.</p>

<p>Thus was Minorca twice lost, after most gallant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
defences against tremendous odds by Generals
Blakeney and Murray. The little island was
destined once more to become a British possession
for a few years, and then to be separated from her
truest and best friends for ever.

<h2 id="II_CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />

<span class="medium table">The third occupation of Minorca&mdash;Loss of British rule</span></h2>

<p>When the War of the French Revolution broke
out England had no base within the Mediterranean.
The necessity for such a base was very much
increased when Napoleon got possession of Malta.
Lord St. Vincent had taken the command of
the Mediterranean station in December 1795; on
February 14, 1797, he fought the great battle
which gave him his title, and afterwards kept up
the blockade of Cadiz. He knew that Napoleon
was meditating the Egyptian expedition, and
detached Nelson with thirteen sail of the line
to watch and, if possible, to intercept the enemy.
At the same time he sent home an urgent appeal
for reinforcements, and Sir Roger Curtis was
sent to him with eight sail of the line.</p>

<p>Lord St. Vincent came to the conclusion that
the possession of a base within the Mediterranean
for the English fleet was of such importance that
it was necessary to occupy Minorca once more.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
He was not a man to let the grass grow under his
feet. He had no sooner come to this conclusion
than he proceeded to act upon it. He organised
a squadron of six ships, to be led by Commodore
Duckworth:</p>

<p class="table">
<i>Leviathan</i> (74), Commodore Duckworth.<br />
<i>Centaur</i> (74), Captain John Markham.<br />
<i>Argo</i> (44), Captain J. Bowen.<br />
<i>Aurora</i> (28), Captain Caulfield.<br />
<i>Cormorant</i> (20), Captain Lord Mark Kerr.<br />
<i>Peterel</i> (16), Captain Charles Long.<br />
</p>

<p>The squadron convoyed several transports with
troops under the command of General the Hon.
Charles Stuart, a younger son of the Earl of Bute,
the Prime Minister. After a tedious passage,
owing to contrary winds, the squadron brought to
within five miles of the port of Fornelle, on the
north coast of Minorca, on November 7, 1798.
Fornelle is a very large and spacious harbour,
but it contains many shoals and much foul ground.
On the west side of the entrance there is an old
fort, consisting of four bastions connected by
curtains. On the other side there is an <i>atalaya</i>
or signal station. After a reconnaissance, it was
decided that Fornelle was not a desirable place
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
for landing the troops. It was decided to send
the smaller ships and transports to Addaya Creek,
while the two line-of-battle ships stood off and on
outside.</p>

<p>Addaya forms a large harbour on the north-east
coast of the island, with a valley surrounded
by lofty bare hills, which shelter it from the bleak
north-westerly winds. The valley produces every
kind of vegetable in abundance, while the vineyards
and fruit gardens yield grapes, oranges, and
pomegranates in profusion. One of the very few
springs in the island sends down a stream, whence
irrigating channels were conducted to every part
of the valley. This is one of the most delightful
spots in Minorca; but the harbour is full of rocks,
and is only safe for small vessels.</p>

<p>Here General Stuart landed his troops and
immediately occupied the surrounding heights,
the Spaniards retreating to Ciudadela and Port
Mahon. There was no fighting, and the whole
island surrendered to General Stuart, including the
castle of San Felipe, on November 15.</p>

<p>The Commodore, hearing a report of strange
sail being in sight, proceeded to Ciudadela with
the <i>Leviathan</i> and <i>Centaur</i>, and at daybreak on
the 13th five sail were reported from the <i>Centaur’s</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
masthead. An exciting chase was at once commenced.
The strangers were large Spanish
frigates, and they hauled their winds for Majorca.
The <i>Leviathan</i> returned to Ciudadela that evening.
Captain Markham of the <i>Centaur</i> set every stitch
of canvas and continued the chase until the 14th,
but he was completely outsailed by the Spaniards.
He returned to Port Mahon on the day of the
surrender, writing home that ‘the whole island is
now in our possession, without loss of any kind.’
He received 884<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> as his share of the capture
of Minorca.</p>

<p>The possession of Port Mahon, in a war with
France and Spain combined, provided a base for the
fleet whence the Spanish coast could be harassed
and the approaches to Toulon watched and hindered.</p>

<p>The <i>Centaur</i> (Captain Markham) and <i>Cormorant</i>
(Captain Lord Mark Kerr) cruised along the
coast of Catalonia, doing some damage to the
enemy in February 1799. The ports of Cambrils
and Salou, memorable as the places of embarkation
of En Jayme I. and his successors, received
unpleasant visits: the guns on the fort at Cambrils
were dismounted, and a large Spanish frigate was
driven on shore and became a wreck. The <i>Centaur</i>
and <i>Cormorant</i> passed April at Port Mahon, and in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
May Lord Mark Kerr received orders to take home
General Stuart and his staff.</p>

<p>In the end of the year Lord Keith had arrived
with eleven ships of the line, as second in command
to Lord St. Vincent, and continued the blockade
of Cadiz. The Commander-in-Chief, owing to ill-health,
was living on shore at Gibraltar. Suddenly
the news arrived that Lord Bridport had allowed
the French fleet of twenty-five sail of the line,
commanded by Admiral Bruix, to give him the
slip from Brest. On May 4 the French fleet
came in sight of Lord Keith, who formed in line
and offered battle. But a gale of wind was blowing,
and Bruix bore up for the Mediterranean.
Keith came to Gibraltar to report the great event
to Lord St. Vincent, and the old veteran at once
hoisted his flag on board the <i>Ville de Paris</i> and
took command, ill as he was. Taking Lord Keith
under his orders, he proceeded with the fleet to
Port Mahon, the object being to engage the enemy
and prevent him from getting into Toulon.</p>

<p>At midnight on May 21 Lord St. Vincent made
sail towards Toulon; but on June 2 he became so
ill that he was obliged to return to Port Mahon,
and on the 18th he resigned the command to Lord
Keith and went home. On July 3 the fleet came
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
in sight of Toulon, the <i>Centaur</i> (Captain Markham)
being ahead. Owing to some news he received,
Lord Keith then crowded all sail for the Bay of
Rosas, in hopes of intercepting the French fleet.
But there was disappointment, and once more he
shaped a course for Toulon. The <i>Centaur</i> was
always the advanced ship, well ahead, the frigate
<i>Bellona</i> being five miles astern, and the rest of
the fleet out of sight. At 9 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> on June 18
five strange sail were reported from the masthead.
A very exciting chase immediately began at a
distance of about sixty miles from Cape Sicie
on the French coast. The strangers proved to
be three French frigates and two brigs. After
nine hours the <i>Centaur</i> came up with the sternmost
frigate, and fired into her. She struck,
and Captain Markham made a signal to the
<i>Bellona</i> to take possession. Again making all
sail, he came up first with the second and then
with the third frigate, which both struck, as well
as the brigs. The prizes were brought to Port
Mahon, and all were taken into the British Navy.</p>

<p>Lord Keith cruised off Toulon for some days
and then went to Genoa; but still there were
no authentic tidings of the French fleet. Once
more he stood towards Minorca, and received a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
reinforcement of twelve sail of the line under
Admiral Collingwood. But on June 24 the French
fleet left the Mediterranean, and on July 12 it was
at Cadiz. Lord Keith determined to try for news
at Gibraltar, arriving on the 14th, only to receive
the maddening intelligence that the enemy was
just two days ahead of him. Then began a
desperate chase; for if the French fleet could be
forced to give battle, it would be the most
momentous event in the war. On the 30th Lord
Keith left Gibraltar with thirty-one sail of the
line. He was just too late. The <i>Centaur</i> looked
into Brest and saw forty sail of the line safely
anchored there, being the French fleet under
Admiral Bruix and the Spanish fleet under Admiral
Mazaredo. They had got in only six hours before,
and Keith was gaining on them fast. Lord Keith,
stung with anguish at the disappointment, sadly
returned to Port Mahon.</p>

<p>Minorca continued to be a very important
base for the operations of the British fleet, whence
Lord Keith obtained his memorable successes on
the coast of Egypt. But when the Peace of
Amiens was signed on March 26, 1802, Minorca
was ceded to Spain. The long connection of the
little island with England was thus severed for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
ever, and to the Minorcans was only left a tradition
and a memory of happier and more prosperous
times.</p>

<p>Such prosperity as Minorca has since enjoyed
has been due to her excellent harbour, the fame of
which as a safe place of refuge gave rise to Andrea
Doria’s well-known proverb:</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Los puertos del Mediterraneo son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Junio, Julio, Agosto y Puerto Mahon.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>So long as sailing ships were the means of locomotion
at sea, crowds of merchant vessels frequented
the port. It was also visited by the
British fleet in the Mediterranean, which always
received a cordial welcome in memory of the good
old times. The Spanish Government undertook
stupendous works of fortification at Cape Mola,
on the eastern side of the entrance of Port Mahon.
The introduction of steam reduced the importance
of the harbour, which became less and less frequented.
The garrison was withdrawn and the
works at Cape Mola were abandoned, all sources
of wealth to the islanders. Minorca has indeed
fallen from its high estate. There is stagnation
and poverty. A former Consul,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> in lamenting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
this decadence, truly said that ‘those who do
visit Minorca will find a bright little town and
friendly inhabitants, some of whom yet express in
broken English their love for England, while they
speak joyously and feelingly of the good and
flourishing times when Minorca was under British
rule.’</p>

Work with A NEW POSTSCRIPT, was published on <b>March 10,

the completion of the Edition in <b>December 1909</b>.</span></p>

<h3>SOME PRESS OPINIONS OF THE RE-ISSUE.</h3>

<p>The <i>SPECTATOR</i>.&mdash;‘We cordially hope that the success of this new venture will
be all that its merits entitle it to. The work is really indispensable to the student,
and every public library, not to speak of private purchasers, should be supplied with a
copy.’</p>

<p><i>DAILY TELEGRAPH.</i>&mdash;‘To those who have had occasion to use the Dictionary
to any great extent it must have long appeared invaluable, and they may well
be amazed at finding it now in volumes of close upon 1,500 pages issued at a price that
makes it one of the cheapest works of the kind ever put before the public.... In welcoming
this new and marvellously cheap re-issue, which will cost only one-third of its
original price, and will occupy only one-third of the shelf space, we may say that no
public reference library will, in future, be worthy of the name that does not contain the
Dictionary in one or other of its forms.’</p>

<p>The <i>BRITISH WEEKLY</i>.&mdash;‘The Dictionary in its new issue should become a
universal household possession. There is nothing to compare with it anywhere. No
greater service was ever rendered to English literature than was rendered by its publication.
It is in short priceless.... The re-issue ought to be in every public library,
and in every private library of any pretentions. As it stands it is about the cheapest
book in the market.’</p>

<p>Professor <span class="smcap">Max F&ouml;rster</span> in the <i>JAHRBUCH DER DEUTSCHEN SHAKESPEARE
GESELLSCHAFT</i>, 1908:&mdash;‘It is an absolutely indispensable work for
all engaged in literary history, and for a long time to come will remain one of the
proudest ornaments of England’s work in scholarship.’</p>

DICTIONARY OF NATIONAL<br />
BIOGRAPHY INDEX and EPITOME<br />

<span class="large">Edited by SIDNEY LEE.</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This volume is intended to form a summary guide
to the vast and varied contents of the Dictionary and
its Supplement. Every name, about which substantive
biographic information is given in the sixty-three
volumes in the Dictionary or in the three Supplementary
Volumes, finds mention here in due alphabetical
order. An Epitome is given of the leading
facts and dates that have been already recorded at
length in the pages of the original work, and there is
added a precise reference to the volume and page
where the full article appears.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>ATHEN&AElig;UM.</i>&mdash;‘The appearance of this supplement to the “Dictionary of
National Biography” puts the coping-stone upon a work which is justly regarded as
a national possession.... We can, indeed, conceive no volume of reference more
indispensable to the scholar, literary man, the historian, and the journalist.’</p>

<p><i>OUTLOOK.</i>&mdash;‘A complete biographical dictionary, containing names and references,
to be counted literally by the thousand, altogether inaccessible inside the covers of any
other single volume.... The EPITOME is worthy of the DICTIONARY. Could
greater praise be given?’</p>

<p><i>TIMES.</i>&mdash;‘This newly-published INDEX AND EPITOME may seem a mere
trifle compared to the rest, but is, in fact, a remarkable piece of work.... As far as we
have been able to test it, this design has been so admirably carried out as to give the
work a real value and importance of its own.’</p>

<p><i>WESTMINSTER GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;‘A volume of the highest practical utility....
We have tested the work by several consultations, and have found it answer exactly to
the excellent plan outlined in its preface.’</p>

<p><i>PALL MALL GAZETTE.</i>&mdash;‘This final volume will convince every one of the
Dictionary’s wonderful utility, and indeed introduce the work to many who may not
be able to afford the original volumes.’</p>

<p><i>SCOTSMAN.</i>&mdash;‘This volume of the Dictionary will soon be the best-thumbed of
them all. Only long and frequent use upon particular occasions fully tests a book
of this kind; but it needs no very exhaustive scrutiny to reveal that the EPITOME
is a work well organised, of exact learning, and of a careful compilation. Useful in
itself, it must largely enhance the usefulness of the Dictionary which it serves.’</p>

The more generally accepted story is that when the Count
of Barcelona was severely wounded in a battle between Charles
the Bald and the Normans, the Emperor came to the wounded
Count’s tent and asked what reward he could give to a warrior
to whom he owed so much. The Count asked for the grant of
a charge on his plain gold shield. The Emperor dipped his hand in
the blood from the Count’s wound, and passed his four fingers
down the shield. ‘A device gained by blood,’ he said, ‘should be
marked with blood.’</p></div>

The Teutonic word <i>Rik</i> signified valiant or powerful, not rich
in our sense. It was a frequent ending to names, as Theodoric,
Alaric. The <i>Ricos Hombres</i> of Aragon bore a caldron on their arms,
as a sign that they could maintain many men in the field, and they
used a <i>se&ntilde;era</i>, or banner. These were ‘Ricos Hombres do Se&ntilde;era.’
There were also nine families of ‘Ricos Hombres’ ‘le naturaleza,’
nobles before the Moors came. These were Cornelas, Lunas,
Azagras, Forcas, Urreas, Alagones, Romeos, Entenzas, Lizanas.
Several Castilian nobles, especially the Dukes of Medina Sidonia,
also bore caldrons on their arms.</p></div>

The chronicle of Muntaner was written in the Catalan language,
and first published at Valencia in 1558, and next at Barcelona in
1562. Buchon published a French translation at Paris in 1827
in the ‘Collection des croniques nationales Fran&ccedil;aises.’ In
1844 an Italian translation was published at Florence. Buchon
published a new translation in 1848 in the <i>Panth&eacute;on Litt&eacute;raire</i>.
Dr. Lanz published a German translation in 1842 at Leipzig; and
added the Catalan text in a volume published at Stuttgart in 1844.
In 1860 a Spanish translation, with the Catalan text in parallel
columns, edited by Don Antonio de Bofarull, was published at
Barcelona. As yet there is no English translation of this charming
historical narrative. It was used by Gibbon.</p></div>

A princess of Hainault, through another descent from the
Prince of the Morea, also claimed the Lordship of Clarencia. Philippa
of Hainault, Queen of Edward III., inherited this honorary title,
and it was given to her second son Lionel. This is a more probable
origin of the title than that it was derived from the Lordship of
Clare. In that case it would be Clare, not Clarence.</p></div>

Since Dr. Cleghorn’s time, several natives of the island have
studied its botany.</p>

<p>Juan Cursach, a native of Ciudadela, who was educated at
Montpelier (1759-1837), published at Mahon his <i>Botanicus medicus
ad medicin&aelig; alumnorum usum</i>. He enumerated 270 plants, of
which 160 were said to be natives.</p>

<i>Specimen animalium vegetabilium et mineralium in insula Minoric&aelig;
frequentiorum, ad normam Linneani sistematis.</i> He enumerates
140 plants.</p>

<p>Rafael Hernandez y Mercadal (1779-1857), a doctor of Mahon,
formed a Minorca herbarium of 500 species. It is now lost.</p>

<p>Rafael Oles y Cuadredo, of Ciudadela (1806-1879), in 1859
called the <i>Droguero farmaceutico</i>. It includes an interesting account
of the topography of the island.</p>

<p>Don Juan Joaquin Rodriquez y Femanias studied the vegetation
of Minorca for many years, and published in 1865-68 a <i>Catalogo
razonado de las plantas vasculares de Minorca</i>.</p>

paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
